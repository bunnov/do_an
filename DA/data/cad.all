Neutral	fuck her  what? was she supposed to force her husband not to donate to notre dame? also..just googling salma hayek's name, she's donated to multiple charities. charities for children, charities that raise awareness about violence against women, and for immigrants.      according to wiki, francois created the kering foundation to defend and promote women's rights. this was back in 2008 that he created this. in 2015 he apparently launched the women in motion program to raise gender issues in the film industry.      so....him wanting to donate money to something else he feels deeply about is wrong and erases all of the other good he's done?

Neutral	get out was great, us had some nice ideas and interesting visuals but was not much more than a decent horror movie, to compare a guy with two movies to a legendary director is a bit premature. i'm sure jordan peele wouldn't want that comparison either so i doubt he'd appreciate posts like the one the op submitted either. i heard peele is going to be writing a directing a new version of the twilight zone. i liked his comedy and his other movie about the kitten, keanu, was good too in parts, but in terms of black writer/directors i think ryan coogler and steve mcqueen are more likely to be remembered as great directors based on their output so far compared to jordan peele.
Neutral	agreed
IdentityDirectedAbuse$Slur	reddit fucking sucks a big fake fucking ass.             the community has hit a fucking disgusting new low of fakeness and inoffensiveness it's disgusting. all the fucking subreddits are full of fucking robots that just baffle me with the amount of shit they fucking consume. one of the worst posts that hit my front page just today is this absolute ass of a post about this stupid fucking plant that fucking reddit fucking loves because it fucking pops. that's all. you fucking infantiles. and why on r/blackmagicfuckery?????????? if you fucking retards don't care what fucking content is posted and where it's posted then why not just post a bunch of blank pictures. the fucking comments are always full of these fake fucking hipsters who just fucking hate what's trending to hate and love whatever inoffensive shit they're spoonfed i fucking can't deal with it. reddit has become a fucking dystopia where all the people are just copies of cunts who sit at coffee shops with their laptops every morning from 8-10. meanwhile, you have this one fucking retard in the controversial denying the fucking holocaust like some fucking tinfoil wearing piece of shit.             the fucking straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that r/waterniggas just got fucking quarantined for being offensive. this is a perfect example of taking shit out of context. the fucking sub is just memes about water you snowflake fucking tumblr refugees. if no one's complaining about something then don't fucking act like you're a bunch of martin luther kings purifying reddit of its offensive hate subs! wanna get rid of some fucking hate subs then get rid of r/fragilewhiteredditor for starters.             the problem is that i can't fucking find a good replacement for reddit. i tried going on twitter but i don't fucking know it's not working. so i'm fucking stuck here in a fake fucking utopia. this place is eating my sanity i can't fucking deal with it. someone please please help me get away from this trash fucking website.

Neutral	> according to the fbi, "a hate crime is a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias." the underlying problem with this definition is it elevates non-criminal activity to the level of a crime. spray painting a phallus on the side of a building is vandalism. spray painting a swastika on the side of a building is a hate crime.      >     > the first major problem we run into, then, is that the vast majority of recorded hate crimes fall into a number of activities that normally fall under misdemeanor or even civil categories. these actions include vandalism, simple assault and a vague category the fbi uses called "crimes against society." vandalism alone makes up a third of all events. it is troubling that the state elevates non-criminal matters into a criminal one based nothing on perpetrator motivation. the aforementioned swastika spray paint is no more difficult to clean off than a person scrawling their name.      >     > digging further, the increase in reported hate crimes is driven primarily by these non-criminal acts.      >     > the disparity between real crime where people are harmed or property is irreparably lost and simple misdemeanor activity is staggering.      >     > an indicator hate crime isn't a problem is the rise of the hate crime hoax. according to researcher wilfred reilly, a kentucky state professor of political science, there has been a notable rise in hate crime hoaxes.      >     > in today's united states, there is immense value in becoming a victim of a hate crime. there is an outpouring of social support, tv circuit interviews and other social benefits. being seen as authentic is so strong that people become distraught when they find out they're not the ethnicity they think they are; these individuals are motivated to become a victim of such an event to solidify their social standing.      >     > through the fact that there are *any* hoax events indicates that the problem of hate is, by and large, solved.       >     >  the overwhelming support such people obtain as the immediate snap decision has indicated that our society doesn't tolerate such behavior and, since society doesn't tolerate the behavior, finding individuals is equally rare. one doesn't need to raise awareness when the events are so few that cable news outlets can justify days of debate over each event; we're already pretty much aware the moment they happen. but one does need to raise awareness if they wish to have their 15 minutes of fame.      >     > as i previously noted, the number of people who buy into hate ideology, regardless of motivation, is so trivial that they couldn't even fill a minor league baseball stadium. there are more people than this who think the earth is flat, yet no one considers that a growing trend. it would be impossible to casually talk about nazis being evil if they had any semblance of power or authority as people would tread more carefully. being anti-nazi is a safe and easy way to win social points since there is almost zero risk of reprisal. just ask wilfred reilly, who is on actual enemies lists, just how dangerous they are (they aren't). however, politicians, certain groups and many individuals have strong incentives to manufacture hate crimes where none exist as such events generate votes, revenue and social attention.       condensed version.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	the sjw principle that tone policing is not allowable is rubbish.  tone policing is the rule in the real world and sjw's pious failure to use it internally just incubates a bunch of counterproductive messages and bad tactics, with bad results far wider than the concerns of the particular minority.         a spectacular example is promotion of black lives matter and trans issues.  bathroom bills etc.         the russian troll factory fought both sides on trans issues, blm and other divisive issues before the 2016 election, correctly judging they would work splendidly as wedge issues.          trumpists agreed and pushed them hard.    they became incorporated into the very souls of a generation of youngsters.  kids too young to have much clue about gender build their growing  identity out of ideas like "there are only two genders".     those operations wedged a bunch of otherwise left-leaning people over to trumpism.        i don't know the story of blm but i'm sure indiscipline and naivety by both blm and perhaps more importantly its white supporters, handed trumpists the kind of juicy source material that money can't buy.   i'm not saying blm was not a good movement, just that they got played more than was necessary because of sjw degeneracy and incompetence.        for trans people sjws' self-indulgent competitive wokeness has been a huge factory of material that trumpists used simply by quoting it accurately with no comment.  the photos and memes write themselves.   how well did that all work out for trans people?

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	that'a true.  most women who call themselves feminists are good people who just don't know that the wage gap or inflated rape statistics are bs.  they don't hate men and would support men who are raped or assaulted (unlike some of the posts that get shared here of peoppe claiming that men can't be raped.)  a lot of them believe basically the same things that i do, that neither men nor women should be discriminated against, violence against anyone is bad, women in poor countries often face the worst of sexism and sexual violence, etc.  they just haven't been exposed to the nasty side of feminism, so while i and many people like me have decided that "feminist" may not be the best word to describe what we believe, they have no resaon to believe that the term might not be the best for them to use.

Neutral	this is what marketing people call 'razors and blades'. the profit margin is in the blades, but you don't make any money off of them if you don't have a good razor. for theaters, the movies are the razors and concessions the blades.      it's technically correct to say they "make more" off concessions, but you can't sell a $10 bucket of popcorn if you don't have a good movie playing at the same time, so on the whole it's misleading.
Neutral	shhh, this goes against the "literally every mod and any kind of moderation is bad" narrative.
Neutral	if you want people in general to like you then be a good person, but don't expect that someone will definitely like you just because of that. if you're really a good person you wouldn't care about whether you get something in return.       that's the whole point. there's no contradictions here.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	this sounds elitist as hell, but while there are certainly many good things about how social media has somewhat democratized the dissemination of thought, i find it depressing that so much credence now seems to be put into the hot takes and half-baked opinions of yokels, naive people, the overly-sensitive, bigots, etc.       the worst part is how viral it can be when that portion of the population with poor critical thinking skills/no considered opinion of their own that seemingly needs to be told what to think, or those with a pre-existing agenda, get ahold of it and make it relevant by sharing/repeating it and giving it momentum, and now suddenly it's influencing society to some degree. it happens all over the political spectrum, be it hateful agitation that creates fears or negative sentiments, or someone who decides that something innocuous is offensive if you look at it a certain way and creates outrage where there wasn't any. (of course, meaningful societal changes sometimes come about in the same way - i refer more to tumblrific absurdities like saying it's a sign of patriarchal privilege that condoms are often given away for free but not tampons.)

Neutral	there's nothing really to be outraged about?      if a a state gets a federal grant of sorts, it's usually up to their discretion on how to use it. california could propbably do the exact same thing but just "change" where the funding comes from, then whatever federal money they received would just be spent on something else.      perhaps in alaska for example, where people receive a basic income, grant money from the feds may be used in oil extraction industries that supplement the state government and their basic income.

Neutral	i hate it. i really do.      no, i don't hate sex itself, but i can't go anywhere without hearing about it.      it's been so driven into us by our basic biology and our modern society that 'sex is the means to happiness', that i feel we've moved back on ourselves.      we've turned sex into a commodity, with the 'haves' and 'have nots'. it breeds jealousy and hatred, hence the incel community.      the attitude about not having it is hypocritical too. people will go out and say: "there's nothing wrong with being a virgin!" and then turn around and go "wow this guy isn't getting laid lol."       shit like this is why people feel pressured to go out and fuck just because they feel like they have to in order to be 'living'.      you would think, that as a whole, with as advanced as a society we've become, we would put our more primal desires behind us and put our efforts into other things, but no. we focus on sex sex sex.       in school, sport, reddit, tv, movies, sex is almost always a topic, maybe thinly veiled as 'romance', maybe not.      i get why this happens, but i'm sick of it, and it'll never change.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	this is absolutely hilarious. this is exactly what people who advocate for free speech on social media like jordan peterson (quite ironic since the leftist youtuber being censored in this scenario loves to "debunk" his views) have been talking about for years.       when the "hate speech" crowd asks for specific people or speech to be censored, social media corporations cave in. "bigots" or "bigoted thoughts" get banned, demonetized, removed, or suspended and people celebrate.       as the "hate speech" crowd pushes harder, people who aren't even political get punished. people "associated" with "bigots" get punished. historians get punished. comedians get punished. next thing you know, you and your group that loves to combat "hate speech" get punished.       to anyone who pushes social media censorship and wants to police "hate speech," take a look in the mirror and look what you've done. this is entirely self-inflected.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	well for an overwhelmingly large number of people, it makes more sense to just say the thing that's bothering you instead of trying to reclaim a term overwhelmingly associated with bigoted asswipes.       plenty of people have been frustrated virgins, dealt with bullshit societal problems about sex, relationships, and affection, and that's not something that requires the term "incel" to convey. if you want to  not be associated with that group, then form another term, use the several terms that already existed and predate incels, and so on.      the term "mary sue" is a nuanced concept that was used in a very specific context in fanfiction circles and was conceived with that in mind. it was then expanded and used online in informal ways and is a borderline pejorative toward any kind of woman that does anything vaguely interesting on screen. it's use in that context is reductive despite the nuanced background the term's intended and original use had and it'd be more effective to just verbalize what you're actually experiencing instead of using the lazy intellectual shortcut.      incel if you're serious about not being associated with bigots is what mary sue is. nobody would have a problem with inceldom if there wasn't a large undercurrent of casual misogyny and racism that permeates so much of the communities.      just looking at circles like incels, foreveralone, braincels, etc it's easy to find a thread of someone saying something to the effect of "i wish i had it easy like women" as if women don't have trouble finding love, relationships, and sex too.       if you're honest about this, get out those groups and find better people. incels are fundamentally not the same as frustrated virgins and the distinction comes down to the casual misogyny and racism that infests the communities. we don't need to get to the extreme of rapists or people who shoot places up to talk about the bigoted aspects of these groups.      if you're genuine in that you don't subscribe to that bigoted side of it, get out and get with better people who won't act as a petri-dish for garbage.
Neutral	the problem with that is because their online community is so diffuse, there's nothing to build upon with regards to their local community. it's a lot more efficient to use the platform to highlight existing community figures and groups that listeners can connect to. if a left wing podcast or youtuber interviews lee carter, then one of their fans living in virginia would become aware of having a dsa member in the house of delegates and go volunteer for his campaign. likewise with the various community and advocacy groups.      people like sargon are too arrogant for that. they don't want to just connect people within the movement, they want to be a star on all levels.
Neutral	yes, i've experienced that also.  basically you can repress someone's memory and tell them certain words that will reappear in their psyche when they re-experience the repressed event.      they may even think it's an original idea, if done right. hence the "programming" idea.      this also falls under mentalism though, in manipulating someone's mental state.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	so i posted a question on r/askhistorians a day ago asking "why are eagles always symbolic of power in empires?"   -nothing wrong with that and it was even well recieved with 200+ upvotes.   the problem started when people attempted to comment trying answer this question and start a discussion. according to the subreddit's rules "comments of no value will be deleted". this i'm strongly against as it essentailly allows the mods to delete any comment they want.   -if you want to check the post i made (or literally any post on the sub) you will see an ocean of "[removed]".   the only reason why i'm complaining here and not on their sub is because they banned me.    -after seeing every single comment deleted for little to no reason, someone asked (and im paraphasing): "what did i miss? y the massacre in the comments?"      to which i simply replied: "the mods are arseholes"   -after that, i was instantly banned!   fck you "r/askhistorians", worst subreddit i've ever used.

Neutral	that's a very simplistic way to put it... there is more than just the cut. all the criticism about epic is right. you can't ignore that and say "well they pay more so whatever". they could give 100% and technically be a charity and it wouldn't change anything about why epic store is disliked. not defending piracy, but this sub sometime tries to go too hard on the and-jerk that we end up looking stupid.

Neutral	death of the author stems from the fact that meaning is constructed by the reader. that is, meaning does not exist unless someone creates it; words are not words (that is, symbols that carry meaning) unless someone's interpretting them as such. therefore, the meaning a reader assigns *is* what it means. it might not agree with what the author is saying, but it still exists. since we're working off a system of shared signs, we'll come up with similar interpretations, but... really, even an interpretation that perfectly matched the author's intent in every way would be its own separate thing, since it's created in someone else's mind. that means that there can't be any such thing as a "wrong" interpretation. i think of a book as a like a blueprint for creating your own work.      i had trouble grasping this when i first learned it in college, but when i put it together with previous experiences and thoughts... i've always gotten deeply invested in shipping, and would take it really hard when my preferred pairings didn't work out (haha, "would," as if i'm any different now). i noticed this divergence, where... it was obvious that the intention going into the work was one thing, but the characters i knew felt differently, and that wasn't something i could change. when i started thinking about where the reality of those characters lay... well, i mean, it was less thinking than something i just knew: their thoughts and feelings were really my thoughts and feelings. so, even if my versions of characters were inspired by the writers' versions, they were really separate entities.      also, authors often put implications or contradictions into works that they didn't intend but are nonetheless there. like... i remember hearing this old korean folk tale about this girl who has a blind father. despite his wishes, she goes off on a journey to find medicine to cure him. she almost dies at sea, but is saved miraculously, and ends up marrying a prince. her father is invited to the wedding, and he's in sad shape because he thinks his beloved daughter is dead. but she's able to cure him of his blindness, and he sees she's still alive, and everyone lives happily ever after. the moral of the story is about filial piety. however... maybe this is just because i'm american, but i feel like the story practically deconstructs itself. the fact that magic is required for a happy ending implies that that is *not* how it would work in real life. since we see how devastated the father when he thought he lost his daughter... to me, the story really shows how harmful self-sacrifice can be; sometimes the best thing you can do for others is to take care of yourself. morality tales and propoganda often call attention to their own flaws like that.
Neutral	that's because if you remove the "brown people bad" point from the right wing populists movements in europe, you're left with a party program which could have been written by maduro. just look at italy nowadays, which basically introduced ubi for the long-term unemployed and is on it's way to become greece 2.0 since they think increasing their deficit will boost their economy. and le pen in france calls unironically for the nationalizing of all banks and all energy companies. aoc would be proud of this program.

Neutral	the people who keep advocating for violence are claiming that their opponents are terrorists, in order to justify their own violence.  what a shock.
Neutral	well, yeah, but that doesn't make it any less true. i'm looking at it from the perspective of finding the locus of meaning, and that, i think, (rather ironically), that is something that has a clear-cut answer. i'd also say that death of the author is the very reason we can apply so many schools of criticism to the same works. that is, it's the school that supports the idea that there's no right way to read a text, that we can look at it from all kinds of perspectives. i will say that some post-structuralists take it to an absurd extreme, by saying that authorial intent is irrelevant. which, writing is all about communication, it's important to try to understand other people's thoughts and perspectives. i mean, if all you care about is your own, you're not learning or growing. that's why i prefer to think of it as "birth of the reader." but you know.

Neutral	neither party has a platform to fix this particular problem. the problem is that the last year or so was particularly bad for billing disputes between hospitals and insurance companies. we have mediation sessions to let the patient, hospital, and insurance company negotiate coverage. however, medicare and medicaid recipients obviously can't partake in these because their coverage is set in stone by the government. there's nothing you can negotiate. giving medicare for all, as some of the posters suggested, would not in any way address this problem. it would prevent everybody from being able to negotiate better coverage with their insurer because now their insurer is a set of mandates and not an autonomous company capable of bending rules whenever it feels comfortable doing so.       edit: went ahead and read over the comments again. i made a stupid mistake and assumed any of the posters were responding to the actual contents of the article. i guess that happens when you take the time to read things yourself instead of vomiting party-line nonsense.

Neutral	i understand you dont think it should matter.  it does to a lot of people though.      'heard immunity' = herd immunity       'basicly' = basically      'threatining' = threatening      'reseraunt' = restaurant (i think, from context)      'overperscribing' = over prescribing      'sence' = sense      'inflaiting' =inflating      'equivilent' = equivalent       'concented' = consented      using those words spelled incorrectly does not make you sound like you know what you're talking about, but it does suggest a certain level of education.  food for thought.      i left out the ones that seemed to be switched or just a missing letter typo.

Neutral	there are others who feel this way (not myself, but there are others).      the way i see it is that death is not really much of a concern. if it happens, it happens, and it won't really be my problem. thousands of our ancestors went on to the final frontier, and so must we, so why fret? i'd rather focus on living in the now rather than curling in a ball forever contemplating about death, you know? death's ok to think about for a while, but not all the time.             your young like myself, and we both still have a whole lot of life left to live. either we live it in misery caused by ourselves, or we focus on trying to be happy.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	there is no need to be a conspiracy theorist to see it. the ideologies which undergird the policy, and the tragedy that we read about here are there for everyone to see.      there is a lot of energy in the big yuppy communities of the big modern cities of our western nations behind certain trends of thought about what is and isn't good for kids and about how children's and adults' social development works.       these yuppies love their self help books and their pop psychology. a lot of hacks in the field have found a good market in that demographic to peddle their ideas to. undergirding the whole frame of reference that these people have are the first principles of self centeredness and narcissism. these yuppies (and holland has certainly become a nation dominated by that demographic) have a lot of disposable income and they love going to the shrink, and sending their kids there. these people keep them coming back for months and sometimes years with the idea that some trauma happened in their childhood. all their life troubles can be traced to that. this flies in the face of eons of human experience which has taught us that the human spirit is indomitable, that necessity is the mother of invention and even that hardship builds character. our great grandparents would laugh in the face of these fragile snowflakes. some of them went to work in factories or coal mines and they lost fingers or got black lung. some of their friends died in the horrifying poison gas attacks of wwi.      do you know the events in walt disney's young life that spurred him on to greatness? i read this on the walls of the museum to his honor in san francisco's presidio. he very nearly died in a terrorist bombing that targeted the post office where he worked as a youth. he then signed on a year before he was legally allowed to do so to go to be a medic in wwii in france. when he was a kid, his parents were inclined to invite homeless people in occasionally to give them dinner and chat them up about socialism. by the way, my own grandmother's family did the same. there is actually a sitcom episode on an old black and white show from the 1950s which dealt with this topic i remember seeing once. it was really funny. could you ever imagine a yuppy family doing this, today?      this form of psychological counseling that wants to blame childhood trauma. i'm sure that if these dignified souls who belonged to the octagenarian society in 1929 (youtube video) would be able to get into a time capsule and have tea with the yuppies of today, they'd really want to set them straight.      now, specifically about this 17 year old girl. in my last comment, i pointed out that it is a legally arguable case that the state of the netherlands took this girl's life. the policies of that nation need to be changed, now. and, personally, i would argue the proposition that the premises under which it was done might be based on bad social and psychological science. twenty years ago i stepped into a local city library and was very curious to read an article in the psychology magazine about the rind report. this was a study which established that people are generally not emotionally scarred by instances of molestation in their childhood.the furor of legislators in washington dc was so strong (understand that the christian right had just experienced a decade of growth and had become a powerful political force). capitol hill censured the scientists who produced that report.       now, just think. a society which prevents scientists from doing their work in a fair-minded way  in respect to the observations that they make is shooting itself in the foot. that's our usa which did this, not some third world banana republic. but recently, with masses of people who don't believe the facts that experts such as robert mueller gather, because of a propaganda organization that has standing as a news agency, the us is starting to look more and more like a banana republic, isn't it?       there needs to be firm separation between government and academia, just as there needs to be one between religion and government.      nations and peoples can only reject science and its research at their peril. and i wouldn't say that they suffer the judgement of god for this, like the people of the octagenarian society back in 1929 might have, but there are natural consequences.      we should all be sad that the government of netherlands thinks that it's ok to kill a child because of some weird fad of pop psychology that has taken root in the halls of western academia.      it's a shocking abuse of human rights, and **action needs to be taken now**,  and yes, for the sake of the children.      is that clear enough to you?

Neutral	[URL]      [URL]      i heard someone talking about epstein's new mexico property, and they called it "zorro ranch". i thought they were making a joke about the pulp character zorro at first, but that is literally what his property is named.       realizing this, i was reminded of something i'd heard random rants of ryan talk about. it's one of the examples of "pizza" being used as a suspicious code to hide corruption, and the news article about this that i linked above predates "pizzagate" by months. i remembered that another code that went unexplained there was "zorro". they used these codes, "pizza" and "zorro", to hide corruption, and we know about this from way back in july 2016. meanwhile, "pizzagate" hit the scene months later after john podesta's emails were released by wikileaks, and they also contained coded messages about "pizza".       i haven't seen anyone else connect these dots, but what are the chances these connections are mere coincidence? people always focus on epstein's island in the caribbean, and apparently locals called it "pedophile island", but maybe there is something worth looking at going on in new mexico too. anyone have any ideas for what "zorro" might mean? it's spanish for fox if that means anything to anyone.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	the purpose is not pride itself but pride in response to a society and historically, a government that was oppressive and discriminatory. this hasn't been the case for asexual people for at least a century, and even before that, the worst case was the expectation to marry and produce children, which would have been necessary in practical terms for most anyway.       so i don't see how asexuality fits into the lgbt framework.

Neutral	if trump was guilty of everything he was charged of, a traitor worthy of execution, an asset of russia working against the state, an open and shut case, you'd think he'd be reprimanded in some way. that they'd want to take the atomic football away as quickly as possible. how irresponsible would the fbi, cia, mueller be for letting this drag out so long.      we're about 50 nothingburger's into this. the dossier turned out to be fake. clinton and cnn both said russia collusion was just a political play with no backing. stormy daniels had to pay trump's lawyer fees. buzzfeed's bullshit was fake. has -anything- turned out to be real? wrapping up this case is logically nothingburger 51.       everyone around trump's admistration that's been found guilty has been tangentially related at best. manafort was found guilty for money laundering, and crimes related to helping ukraine... in the ukraine conflict that was in defense against russia. others have been perjury. manafort's crimes are lesser than what was found in clinton's group to boot. that's all. cohen was supposed to be this huge bomb, and he had no proof either, and just further perjured himself.      it's fine to have doubts, it's not over til it's over, but previous investigations and evidence point to this being nothing.

Neutral	thats totally valid. even the sensitive people have tells that something is much more serious than usual, for example if completely shutting down instead of crying is very abnormal you might take that more seriously.  anytime anyone has signs of distress that are very abnormal it should be taken more seriously than your regular having a bad day/getting your feelings hurt.       i have experienced both worlds because i had compassion fatigue from my job in animal rescue and was completely desensitized to trauma for a few years in order to get by. went from a highly sensitive person to one who could rarely cry without alcohol and back again.

Neutral	ok, i checked it out again. if an ambulance was called and it was medically necessary, your insurance will cover the cost, with you paying maybe 10€ top.      if you call, the person at the hotline can help you out and say wether or not an ambulance is necessary. if he says it isnt necessary and you still decide you want it, but it really wasnt necessary, you gotta be ready to pay a couple 100€.      if you have an epileptic attack and call the ambulance, but it stops when it arrives and you decide not to drive to the hospital, you have no right for the insurance to pay either.      so yeah. if the ambulance was necessary you aint gotta pay, but if it wasnt necessary...

IdentityDirectedAbuse	the entire point of the satanic church is to get religion out of where it shouldn't be. why people freak out about other people pretending to praise a fictional character, is beyond me. the much bigger threat seems to be the people who actually believe in a diety, in whose scriptures he himself is the source of most death and misery.      full disclosure, i'm not a satanist, but religion poisons everything and i think that the satanist are more on the side of civil liberty than most christians i've met.

PersonDirectedAbuse	i started off as a sanders supporter in 2016. i was tuned in when maddow had trump's tax returns from '95. i was fucking thrilled to get that asshole out.      and then it turns out that whole narrative was false. in fact, trump was paying more than obama. neato.      it didn't deter many of those in that sub, however. and the more radical they got, i'd still try my best to have a discussion, but before i knew it, i was being labeled a racist neo-nazi trump supporter. got real fucking tired of it.      so i went over to t_d, outright stating i didn't care for trump and voted sanders. and you know what? they were cool with it. why? because i was chatting with them in *good faith*. i wasn't yet another asshole joining their subreddit to call them nazis and whatever else. surprise, surprise, they were all (well, mostly all) happy to have rational, level-headed discussions. we could disagree with each other and still be kind.      that was when i realized i had been blatantly lied to the whole fucking time. and it shouldn't be a surprise--they're people too. they want to be respected just as much as the sanders guy. they had fair opinions and positions just as i did. who'd have thunk it.

Neutral	she saw a rope hanging in a freaking factory of all things and jumped to the conclusion that it's a racist act. then, instead of just reporting it to hr she posted it all over social media, which ruins the reputation of the company for no good reason. at best she's an attention seeking moron and at worst she set this all up for extra victim points and donations to her gofundme.  she will have a really hard tome finding another employer at this point, and rightfully so.      btw, this sub has clearly illustrated that the demand for hate crimes outweighs the supply.

Neutral	fascism is not a right nor left wing ideology, in fact it's not even on the political spectrum because it's not a standard set of policies. if you had to place it, then it would be high authoritarian centrism.       it's also much better than the materialist and anti-human ideologies of communism(totalitarianism) and capitalism(republicanism).

Neutral	even if we did hide weapons in the humanitarian aid the correct response wasn't to burn it but search it which has the added benefit of giving you a bunch of free weapons to give your military if you found them. the other thing he could have done that would have been just as awful but be less obvious is if he just had the military commandeer the trucks (while saying they will distribute it themselves) and handing it all over to the military.       point being, no matter what you think of us humanitarian aid burning it was the wrong response.

Neutral	the incident reads almost like satire of the confucian social hierarchy where wives and children are worth nothing than meat when compared to men of higher social status. 3 kingdoms isn't satire though and is completely serious with its promotion of confucian patriarchal oppression in scenes like that one which gives me the creeps as well.          there's this saying 老不读三国 which means that old people shouldn't read 3 kingdoms because it teaches grown men to betray, cheat and steal. i don't know how old the saying is but for at least a few decades to centuries its commonly understood in chinese culture that its confucian veneer is not right and its characters are not to be emulated. i still love the story but i still have reconcile it with the fact that its morality is at best hypocritical and at worst a textbook in evil.

Neutral	-rampant cronyism & corruption: this is another obvious one. it's terrifying to think that it's transparent now... they don't even have to try to hide it. that is a red flag, you guys... i mean, google is saying they're going to rig search engine results and youtube trending charts to avoid another trump term... and even dishonest reasons sometimes. they don't have to tell the truth, they can do terrible things that screw the working class, they can wage unjust wars, they can take money from shady sources, and what are we going to do? it's like they're taunting us with that: "yeah, i just screwed you over, and everybody knows it was me. and i already have billions, but i felt like having a little bit more. and everybody knows i have all your information already. and nobody cares. what are you going to do about it?" kinda like how google got rid of the euphemisms, and straight up started admitting banning people they don't like: "alt right!" hmm... you know what that sounds like? jewish people. only instead of stars of david, they'd better have their democrat memberships on them, they're going to start banning more and more conservatives now, or they're going to be calls to their employers to fire them from their jobs, and their kids are going to be starving on dirt floors getting assaulted by cultural marxists accusing them of misogyny and white supremacy.      ​      also, cultural marxists is going to be able to shred evidence of their atrocities easier as google is starting to use their authoritarian powers to get rid of the people warning us to prevent them from doing this.      ​      -fraudulent elections: this is the iffy one. this is luckily the one that isn't 100% certain. i know that the polls, as noam chomsky once said: "are designed to control the voters." and influence how we vote. i know google is going influence the next election. and i'm from california, one of the most liberal states in the nation: and thousands of people who were registered as "republican," as you had to be to vote for donald trump, were changed to either "liberal," "libertarian," or "independent," due to a "glitch in the system." (hmmmmm.....) but that isn't a regular occurrence so much. i mean, trump winning against a 20 year-congresswoman and former first lady is astounding. that one is still up for debate.      ​      **so, what do you think? anything you'd like to add?!**

Neutral	> neither of these seem to be anything of what people are saying.       first of all, one, "piracy helps me try games before i buy" is one, if not the biggest argument for piracy.       second, the first being true, "i'll pirate the game to spite the developers" is the *second* most common argument for piracy.      > non-americans seem to forget other countries often have a difficult time purchasing games.      what the f--      oh, yeah, totally. i mean, nintendo literally didn't produce systems in brazil for half of the wii u / 3ds lifespan and only just got back in its industry, and obviously the inconvenience of downloading a 80mb app is on the exact same level of legal fuckery as "we do not officially sell our products in your country".      conversely, i've seen almost no one argue against people who *literally cannot buy a game legally* pirating, much like how no one gives a shit if you download the original *super mario bros. 3*. but games like *the outer worlds* and possibly *borderlands 3* *aren't even out yet.*      do you *actually* fucking think *any* of the people in the linked thread aren't red-blooded, glued-to-their-seats americans, let alone westerners?

Neutral	having bad parents can also fuck you up in really intangible ways as well.       - growing up, whenever my sisters or i fuck up, my mom would either yell at us or actually hit us. heck, we got yelled at whenever we're in our mom's way. this is more applicable on my older sister than the rest of us but there's no exemption.         - my mom cheated on my dad emotionally. had an affair with a guy that was doing renovations to our house for 1.5 yrs or so. she also made me keep track of my dad's phone calls as well. i kinda feel bad for her cause she was married at 17 and according to my grandparents "turned into a demon" after. she became a mom of 3 at 23 and was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression (even though it does not look like it).      - apparently my dad also had an affair w/ a co-worker (or very suspect interactions with her) when i was a boy.      - my parents would buy gifts for my sisters randomly and use emotional manipulation about it. it got to the point where they feel guilty whenever they randomly gets gifts and i told my parents to never get me anything. it also made me hate hate hate gift-giving to this day.      - my parents are also poor financial spenders, especially my mom. she wants to work but my dad won't let her cause women only work at home.      - my parents are your typical desi, muslim parents back from the motherland. enough said.            while they do take care of us, and i love them, they also made shit decisions that's very hard to overlook.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i think you're the minority. incels without hate has way less subscribers than mainstream incel communities. stop identifying as an incel and start identifying as you. as a woman i can tell you right now, i've been infatuated with some objectively unattractive guys many times. they just weren't interested in me! it may sound like a cliche, and i don't deny that lookism exists, but personality and how you see yourself does matter. low self confidence and poor self image are very unattractive, some of the hottest guys i've ever seen still had poor self image and it was a huge turn off for me. as a man, you're actually at an advantage outside of dating culture (in things that matter, like career and business) because women are judged on looks alone, not on ability. be thankful people take other parts of you into consideration by default. speed dating may suck, but it's in no way something that should handicap you. no one will be attracted to you if you label yourself an incel.       i won't pretend to relate with being unattractive because i am not. but someone's looks has never been the deciding element of if i find them attractive, and many of my friends are dating or engaged to guys who aren't really the best looking. just carry yourself with poise and confidence and the right people will notice. best wishes.

Neutral	establishing and maintaing a business is a difficult and arduous task, that requires massive dedication and a large investment of time, money and effort. start-up business owners can't just lay back and do meaningless paperwork while the profits roll in; they have to work their arses off to get their businesses off the ground.      if a business becomes successful, and they can begin to afford to hire someone else to do some of the work, then they have earned the right to own their "means of production". but even the owners of large businesses often still have to work hard to ensure that their business does not collapse. the fact that they are no longer physically labouring is irrelevant; it is a job that requires skill, experience and dedication- and one that most people are unable to fill.      the customer of the business pays money to the business owner to receive the desired product, and the worker receives a certain amount of money to operate the means of production that the business owner has worked to obtain. any profit that the business owner gains is his payment for the work that he has put in.

Neutral	it was a hostile take over by the sima family, by the time cao cao died his second son cao pi took the reins and declared himself emperor. cao cao was very adamant about never doing this because he still considered himself a servant of the han dynasty. cao pi died shorty afterwards and his son cao rui took over. cao rui was just as incompetent as shu-hans emperor liu chan(liu bei son) or a dou. didn't take long for the sima family to take over. these new emperors were too caught up in spending their empires wealth on luxury. i feel like this is the case because they were all born into a state of temporary peace, the three kingdoms deadlock was already in effect so no one really attacked each other for a few years(massive battles) so these new emperors has absolutely no military experience.

Neutral	what did marco polo mean by this?
Neutral	i think you need to think about your audience when you're making those comments, instead of taking it personally.        in a subreddit about anxiety, maybe they are too anxious to respond. maybe they are busy fighting with anxiety and don't want to type out a long response to you. maybe they read your post, appreciated it, and then the thought of getting help overwhelmed them. maybe they never saw it at all because they panicked and logged out after posting.       in a subreddit about depression, maybe they are too depressed to respond. maybe they are busy fighting depression. maybe they appreciated your post, but can't gather the energy/motivation to type a response to it. maybe they feel they've already wasted enough of your time.       in a confession subreddit (or one like this one), people aren't necessarily posting for your input. maybe they just need to write it down and get it out there. sometimes a person doesn't want advice in that case, so replying saying "thanks for the advice!" feels fake. maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like "thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all". or, maybe they read and appreciate the advice, but they don't think thanking everyone who gives unsolicited advice is a good idea.       all of those are subreddit-specific reasons, but there's also reasons like... maybe they got a lot of responses and don't want to reply 20 times saying "thanks!". maybe your comment is identical to 5 other people and they've already explained/answered your questions elsewhere and don't want to do it again. maybe they intend to reply, but get interrupted and forget. maybe they don't see replying to random reddit people as a priority.       in short, it's probably not personal. just relax. no one is an asshole just because they don't thank you for your advice. your advice should be like a gift - they don't owe you anything in return, and if they do, it's not really a gift.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i guess this is a valid negareddit opinion, since reddit does like doctor who (at least they did before those spooky sjws cast a woman as the doctor).      but it does sound kind of like the "new version of x has ruined my childhood" reactionary whining we've come to love whenever an old franchise gets rebooted with even a hint of progressiveness.       i mean, most of the people who started watching the new who weren't going to stumble on old episodes of hartnell or baker and get into the fandom that way. but now we have new fans coming in, and the classics are getting some attention. like the big multi-week stream that twitch did last year of some of the classic serials.

Neutral	essentially liu bei is generally portrayed as a benelovent leader who highly values his men, which is why even tho he is likely the least capable of the major warlords, he has the best men working under him. like, the quality of generals and tactician he has access to is just insanely stacked.       zhaoyun is a legendary general. he is not as famous as lu bu in the west, but he is far more famous of a character in east asia and is basically a lu bu tier martial warrior that is the perfect knight. think galahad. from arthurian legends. the way he is potrsyrd, dude is as invincible of a warrior as lu bu, but without the treachery.       so he risked his life and fraught through a whole army single handed to get his lord's son back. liu bei was so touched by his action that he felt nothing could be worth risking such a loyal man of talent. him throwing his son to the ground is an outburst of emotion over how grateful he is to the general. he didn't actually throw him, he got stopped in time (or zhao yun caught the baby). either way, a baby wasn't hurt      literary analysis of the scene is actually pretty interesting, since there is a school of thought that presumes liu bei to be a master manipulator. a guy who knows how to get the best people to be loyal to him. from that perspective, he did what he did to put on a show for zhao yun.      also, remeber that romance of the 3k basically fiction.

Neutral	>my problem is i tend to take the stories at face value and not pick up on deeper meanings, until i read up about them afterwards.      that's actually a perfect way to go about it! i'm willing to bet you are improving more than you think. searching out what smarter people think and coming up with your own theories is how i was taught. if there's a better way i don't know it.      for music the grateful dead are my best example. they even have a book dedicated to the symbology they use that i think is posted online. they make *heavy* use of symbolism and are just great to listen to.       the catcher in the rye is a fun book. it uses symbolism and it has story elements you may not pick up on until you experience them yourself. also it's short.      animal farm, lord of the flies, the metamorphosis, heart of darkness, othello are all some examples of books i've personally enjoyed and know there are a lot of resources into their symbolism. i tried to think of varied examples that don't carry on too long.      edit- forgot to add. a lot of the time i don't know what symbols mean right away, either. i just happen to notice "oh hey that's the third time we've seen a white bird" and *then* do some reading or research to see if it means something in the context of the story or what. and even then i might come to a different conclusion about what they mean *exactly*.

Neutral	considering about half of conservatives today started out as liberals at a young age, how does his work?       did they just go from being intelligent to stupid out of nowhere? they went from virtuous kind people to pure evil?      the age issue tells a lot and it's the reason why conservatives better understand liberal policy and beliefs than vice verse (righteous mind - johnathan heidt). most conservatives were already liberals in their younger days so they understand their views, sometimes they even feel sympathy for them. conservatives commonly say in regards to the left "oh, they'll grow out of it". but liberals rarely know what it's like to be conservative so their views are that they just pure evil or stupid. it also has to be maddening for the liberals who grow up and see all their friends and colleagues slowly become more conservative with age while they refuse and stay steadfast in their beliefs, many times doubling down even harder.

Neutral	i mean, to be fair while capitalism itself is not inherently bad, american capitalism sucks. no one wants to regulate or tax anything because doing so would lose them votes. but the lack of regulation ends up hurting the people even more. our healthcare costs are through the roof, our education costs are through the roof, there are multiple locations where the water is poisoned with lead, and not to sound too cliche but, only the rich get richer.              if we were sensible, we'd have a truly progressive tax system where the percentage depends on one's income. this is because if you tax a billionaire at 20% he's still a billionaire, but if you do the same to someone who's working class that puts them in the red. so the rich should be taxed more because they are in a better place to handle it financially. that revenue then would get used to fund programs like single-payer health care, taxpayer-funded higher education, fixing our water supplies (see flint michigan) rebuilding infrastructure etc. and this does not even cover the worker exploitation that happens here.              basically our capitalism sucks because its too capitalist. it is similar to how socialism sucked in the ussr because it was too socialist with not enough economic freedom. therefore one should meet in the middle somewhere to combine elements of capitalism to keep people free, with some elements of socialism to keep people financially stable.

Neutral	yeah but it's "against the rules" in the most technical way possible though if no ones actually wanting to enforce it. my workplace technically has a rule against eating anywhere but the break room but following that rule means me and most supervisors end up running back and forth from the upstairs room to the checkouts if there's any issues, so we would have breaks in the office instead. technically against the rules but doing so was the only way we could have breaks longer than 5 minutes and actually get to eat.      this is a situation where the worker either eats on the line or causes delays, the article basically says so. i'm much more forgiving of an employee needing to eat between assignments and this is far from letting everyone eat.

Neutral	> and while greere's early work is well admired her stance on trans people is not.      but her stance inevitably follows from her early work! as far as i understand it, the foundational principles of radical feminism are that males and females have no innate psychological differences, gender is entirely a social construct, and must be abolished to end female oppression. which is clearly incompatible with the belief that transwomen have female brains that compel them to express female gender roles, and if deprived of that they (and most cis people probably) will become unhappy to the point of attempting suicide.      every time a liberal feminist repeats that gender is a social construct with no biological basis, they affirm that part of the ideology and they only manage to avoid the conclusion by purposefully not thinking it through.

Neutral	i wonder if that person who wrote this will come tear down chinese people appropriating japanese cuisine and opening japanese restaurants all over paris without a single japanese person in them.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	the absolute state of american political discourse.      everyone there has some sort of mental illness which turns them into the most insufferable faggots imaginable, and reddit is just another platform for them to spread their cancer.
PersonDirectedAbuse	imagine being so desperate to feel oppressed that you murder your own pets.         that's insane. this man is a danger to society.

Neutral	it's always a tax issue. that's how they got al capone. the government wants their cut.
Neutral	i see this a bit 25/75: 25% of me is like "damn i guess i said the wrong thing since they didn't comment" and the other 75% is definitely the "yelling into the void" poster. i actually just posted something just to get it out of my system. i didn't really need responses....and i understand what you mean: "why can't they write it in their journal?"      i also write in my journal, but sometimes it's nice just to see people who have felt my struggle without any judgement. that's why i like reddit. no one knows me here and i'm able to just be myself rather than plaster a smile on my face all day like i typically do.  ♀️

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i thought it was a joke. i started doubting because of the downvotes.     oh well, getting 'down'-voted can be considered a joke as well.

Neutral	i'm thinking they're gonna run with harris.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	'articles' and 'studies' lost credibility when they all began pushing the leftist narrative.  if you want me to; vote for, donate to, and support, you and your point of view, you need to present yourself and your argument in a non-biased way and convince me.  if you don't, i'm going to ignore you, and laugh heartily while you reeeee.  good day xir.
Neutral	i was thinking about a reply for a bit, so i wanted to come back, even if slightly late.      most of the history of life on earth is a history of pain, a history of struggle, a history of want. we've been conditioned by evolution to be gluttons. when we have access to food, we eat it. when we can relax, we get lazy. society for basically the first time in history has had to start developing ideas like "dieting" and "exercise" as a means of consciously combating our own basic instincts to over-eat salty/fatty/sugary food, and veg out on a couch.      i think that we're going to have to- through trial and error, regrettably- figure out what's a safe and healthy amount to engage with online content. as gluttons we are, we want more, and the means of consumption have gotten more direct. i'm intrigued to see if in the future we start seeing more tools developed for this; "digital diets" so to speak.
PersonDirectedAbuse	emotional truths about xenophobia and "telling it like it is" are dogwhistles for racism.      you aren't smart or clever for your mental gymnastics. it is just a dictionary definition of cognitive dissonance.

Neutral	it has been a few years for me, but ou always used to be a mess. i used to enjoy uu where the regeneration abilities were at. drawn out battles, a lot of buffing, swapping, predicting - but always with the chance to recover from an unlucky miss or critical hit. it had a great variety of strategies and some really exciting back and forth battles.      ou (back then) was just a 1hko clown fiesta with whatever new mon had been granted the most powercreeped stats.
Neutral	straight pride parade isn't inherently racist, one was started by white supremacists in boston, that's what this tweet is talking about, oof
Neutral	agriculture science is not the same as botany. it's a bit diffuse and overlaps with other disciplines, but it's there for those that study practically anything scientific in regards to farming. but that's my point, everything can be studied as a science, so practically any job would require education in that scientific field. that doesn't make it a stem job. a nurse doesn't do research or develop technology, they apply knowledge that others have gathered.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	who cares that you're banned from 4chan?        surfing that site is like having sex with a toothless meth-addicted gay prostitute with hiv.       sure, coming to browse r/4chan you're still having sex with the same prostitute, but at least you're wearing a condom.

Neutral	am soldier, can confirm.
Neutral	since when does being a corporation automatically mean libertarians are for that entity? pretty sure that's not what libertarians are about (not libertarian myself, so correct me if i'm wrong). being all about minimal government doesn't inherently mean you allow corporations to run amok.
Neutral	i'm not too fond of either side here.  there's the obviously crazy and unlikable "vegan."  but also there are people using the fact that this person doesn't eat meat as an insult.
Neutral	but everywhere!
Neutral	bill bill bill bill bill nye the mechanical engineering degree guy (hydraulic resonance suppressors produced by boeing rule!)             just doesn't have the same ring to it somehow.             also, for a guy concerned about the environment.. i don't see why he owns multiple homes.
Neutral	i watched some episodes from a tv series based on this novel.              it is so confusing and hard to follow but kind of entertaining all the same.              i remember a rather scene where a dude got shot by an arrow and is tearfully lamenting his imminent doom as his son bawls his eyes out. there is a sense it was meant to be dramatic and invoke shakespeare somehow (i doubt it honestly, no way the chinese care about some english poet from hundreds of years ago but it certainly gave me vibes of macbeth or hamlet anyways). however, i thought this scene had narm instead. its meant to be dramatic and sad and yet it just felt kind of awkward.
Neutral	the thing about aces is that they're fighting erasure. like the existence of true aces, with literally no libido and no sexual attraction of any kind to anyone, is pretty much not even acknowledged in most cases. it's brushed off as low libido, closeted homosexuality, or a lifestyle choice rather than an actual difference in brain chemistry. you actually did just that in your comment. the difference between an ace and choosing celibacy is that you don't choose to be ace, you just are. it's not deciding your sexuality is nothing, it's that your sexuality really is nothing. there's a pretty big difference between choosing celibacy because you think it's moral, desire be damned, and choosing celibacy because you flat-out lack those sexual desires. your argument has a lot of the same points as people used to say about gay people "choosing" to be gay. most of us are so steeped in hormones making us want to fuck that we literally cannot imagine not wanting sex at all ever, and being surrounded by the expectation that they're like that even after saying they're ace makes some aces wind up feeling like aliens on a foreign planet. you never realize how much of our society relates to sex in one form or another until you see it through an ace.       if not all of this is true for all aces, i apologise. i learned everything i know about this from a very close friend who's ace and aro, and i'm trying to condense years of talking with her about it into one comment.       tl;dr aces are generally ignored and/or invalidated at every turn even by other people with sexualities in the same boat, it's justified by basically saying "but it's not a sexuality to not want sex so they should be excluded," and that's a shitty, nitpicky attitude. sexuality is just the name for your answer to "what are you sexually attracted to?" and "nothing" is an answer other than "the opposite sex," so aces should be included. they are by definition not heterosexual.
Neutral	at least it's an old fashioned workplace shooting by a former employee.      it's good to get back to the classics after a while.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	the_donald mods have been replaced with lying, shady, manipulative faggots just like the rest of reddit.
Neutral	any sort of overt political stuff is basically that regardless of party or cause.  especially bumper stickers.
Neutral	r/beholdthemasterrace is just lost potential.       i went there looking to mock actual racist troglodytes in a r/tumblrinaction fashion and ended up with this. (not here though, morrissey is a fucking weirdo)      r/trashy serves as a better place to mock them.
Neutral	lol wale has a chris cooley tat
Neutral	the patriarchy, that must be why men constantly walk into each other. i feel like i'd take that particular social theory more seriously if they didn't find the most bullshit ways to apply it.

Neutral	no racist ever stirred up folks against a group much more earnestly than this poster does      all your problems are because of "them"
Neutral	most fights are half assed, neither person wants to pussy out but neither wants to fight, they just do it for the crowd, who don't care who wins they want blood shed. off the fights i've heard/seen maybe 60% never happen. maybe 30% last a minute or two a couple throws verbal jousting, and spitting back and forth and then they leave, next day they give excuses for not fighting by calling the other a pussy
PersonDirectedAbuse	unfortunately money>free speech as far as reddit is concerned.      i promise you, if reddit believes it is in their financial interests to ban r/conspiracy, they would do it without hesitation. it probably wouldn't even take that much. the "wrong" posts, according to the established media, get upvoted after a tragedy, and then if the mainstream media gets a hold of it...      "r/conspiracy users saying attack on (minority group) possibly not done by (majority group) is hate speech"      that headline is all it would take for spez to pull the pulled on this sub.      remember spez is all for free speech......as long as money keeps flowing into his pocket.
Neutral	the study cut off before it got good.  it looks like they observed some variation between studies, did some magic math, and jumped to their conclusion.  still, it doesn't matter.  the gender differences are true for the us and other countries.  it might not be universally consistent, but that is just variations in the human species.          in addition, that was just one of several factors i mentioned.  even in strange places where women populate the extreme against reason, becoming a doctors still takes up 75% of a woman's fertile years.
Neutral	maybe not magic, but definitely check out neuro linguistic programming.
Neutral	**bacha bazi**      bacha bāzī (dari: بچه بازی‎, lit. "boy play"; from بچه bacheh, "boy", and بازی play, "game") is a slang term in afghanistan for a wide variety of activities involving sexual relations between older men and younger adolescent men, or boys. the practitioner is commonly called bacha baz (meaning "boy play" in dari) or simply bach. it may include to some extent sexual slavery and child prostitution.      ***      **pederasty**      pederasty or paederasty (us:  or uk: ) is a (usually erotic) homosexual relationship between an adult male and a pubescent or adolescent male. the word pederasty derives from greek παιδεραστία (paiderastia) "love of boys", a compound derived from παῖς (pais) "child, boy" and ἐραστής (erastēs) "lover". in french, however, pédérastie has been used as a synonym for homosexuality between adult males (see histoire du mot pédérastie).      historically, pederasty has existed as a variety of customs and practices within different cultures.      ***      ^[ ^pm ^| ^exclude ^me ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit ^| ^faq ^/ ^information ^| ^source   ^]   ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Neutral	i'm not really confident in my ability to discern satire from reality, but regardless, those subs are not good for your mind when you visit them too much. it's why i stopped going there, as well as [USER], [USER], and so on.      there's a few that are good without being needlessly judgmental. those are awesome.
Neutral	it's true, chick fill-a only cooks gay chicken

Neutral	ah shit here we go again
Neutral	now that you're here, i can actually respond to this bold statement.      do you actually think that most corporations don't provide anything useful?      the ones that actually matter in terms of emissions are mostly resource extractors and industrial companies, and claiming that most of them are useless is just plain ignorant, even for reddit standarts
Neutral	who payal ?

Neutral	this really started with 9/11. people were demonized for questioning the obvious complete bullshit official story.  you were "mentally unstable" for believing the towers were controlled demolitioned...true investigative journalism basically doesn't even exist anymore. the msm tells us the narrative and we are supposed to believe it totally and completely. anyone, including the rare courageous journalists who dares stand up to the establishment will be publicly slandered by the msm and the brainwashed masses will join in with mockery.      the truth is classified. it is our job to dig it up, drag it into the light of day for all to see. stand back while the shrieking shills crawl out from under their rocks to verbally attack, post brigade and downvote into oblivion.       holocaust, 9/11, uss liberty, zionism, vaccines, greater israel, palestinians, antarctica, the us  moon landings, climate change, pizza gate, isis, chem trails, mass shootings, crisis actors, false flags, clinton body count, codex alimentarius, hollow/artificial moon, holographic universe, ancient technologically advanced civilizations, inhabited mars, giza pyramids cosmic catastrophe warning................,,

PersonDirectedAbuse	yes because the senate and president control what's socially popular. trump got elected and it was like a switch got flipped and now everyone is loudly supporting conservatives. have you by chance been living under a rock or with your head up your ass?

Neutral	it's complete bullshit that r/politics are scrubbing the sub of this because it is a story.      > why does the extreme left seems to be more violent and more prevalent than the thing they stand against.       but this is demonstrably untrue. there were the 12 mail bombing attempts last year. multiple synagogues, mosques, and black churches shot up in the last ~5 years. counter protestor died at charlottesville. has anyone been killed by antifa? what other serious violence can you point to by them aside from this incident? ofc it should be taken seriously but your statement is simply not true, if you want to make a point do it using facts.      > i don't see actual nazis      really?      are you sure about that?      totally positive?      100%?      should i keep going?      if this isnt enough      just google "neonazi news"      and it should be      pretty clear      that there is      an issue.         # btw, these are all from about the last two weeks.      edit : broken link      edit2 : can someone ***please*** explain to me why i'm getting downvoted for this? someone made a claim and i am laying down facts to refute it. what is the issue with my comment?

Neutral	i'm studying a general broad psychology degree right now (so classes in a bit of everything) and the feeling i've always gotten when we've discussed evolutionary psychology is that it currently gets a bit of a side-eye from the different psychological fields for much the same reason freudian style psychoanalysis does. they're both pretty unverifiable. they are how they are because they are.       for example, an evolutionary psychological explanation for getting (sometimes) different outcomes between sexes in spatial/language tests runs along the lines of maybe that's because historically, men needed better spatial skills because they roamed further to hunt while women needed better language skills to mediate conflicts that, as the generally smaller sex, could be fatal for them if they escalate. it's a nice simple theory that makes superficial sense but it can never move past theory because there's simply no way to gather evidence to support it. it's also somewhat reductionist, which is always a warning sign with psychology that something is hinky. if a theory or the outcome of a study doesn't come with at least a dozen caveats, it definitely doesn't encapsulate more than a tiny segment of humanity.

Neutral	the middle path forgetting that moderation and balance is key particularly when it comes to politics and ideology leads to wonderful circle jerks like r/enlightenedcentrism. all civilizations are built on compromise.              "men are born soft and supple; dead they are stiff and hard. plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. the hard and stiff will be broken. the soft and supple will prevail." - lao tzu

Neutral	i think the writer has a point, honestly. rowling wants all the credit for having a gay character while not actually making him gay. we didn't know ~~dumbledore~~ kroger-brand gandalf was gay until after the last book came out and she said "oh yeah, he's gay," which was a shock to people because there's literally nothing about it in the books. i can understand lgbtq people wanting gay representation in literature to actually be there and not to just be told "you know that character you really liked? he was gay the whole time," after they finish the book.

Neutral	ss: the idea or theory of herd immunity is totally misunderstood.  most people believe this makes the population immune to disease.  the linked article shows the truth of the matter.  this theory is only to reduce the possible vectors of infection when a population contracts a disease. it has literally nothing to do with being immune to disease and is only a method of control.      so the recent media about measles and chickenpox is complete bs and designed to cause an emotional reaction in the population in order to pass new legislation mandating vaccinations.      let the down votes begin!!

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	dear sub-human filth,      i'm appealing to all of you stupid idiots to vote democrat in 2020. that is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. i understand the majority of you racist rednecks can't even read this post, though. but those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family.      we democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. i will qualify myself by noting that i have a liberal arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. i also have a black friend. i have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. therefore you, personally, are also terrible.      i don't know you, but i know that you're racist. i also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms.      the religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because i'm smarter than you and i'm telling you so. it is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and i'm better than you.      you see, us democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. if you don't agree, i hate you.      it's not too late to change. if you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in america when indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as i'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, where you belong. that will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. we'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do.      all of you stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal. if you only understood that you wouldn't be so much worse of a person than i am.      so please vote democrat. help me help you, you worthless motherfuckers.

Neutral	i will be straight. i do not care for that sub. it's not something i'd ever get into myself.      but banning this sub doesn't prevent anyone from actually dying. it does not harm anyone. banning it is just a virtue signal, a way of pointing to the people who did like it and scolding them like bad dogs.

Slur	let me tell you this-- [USER] is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. you think [slur]town was bad? that subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about stormfront, at least it bans "n[slur]"), will reveal itself to you as reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened nazis, klansmen, fascists, and gamergaters. you'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. that's intentional. they encourage arguments in the comments section. that's intentional. you know the three minute hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? it's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. they brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. they've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. i fear that [USER] may be producing an entire army of dylann roofs and elliot rogers, and i highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura.

Slur	it's a common practice. as an artist i've seen many of my peers in situations like this. some time ago an artist got blacklash because she made tiana and the sjws didn't like the skin tone and the anime nose. there are many anime styles, but the cute big eyed+ small nose is popular and easy to do. it would be weird if in a simplified style you would make a broader extra detailed nose. the background setting and light matters too. lighting and shading can affect skintone too. it's one thing if it's realism, but with anime styles you don't have to have realistic proportions ( nobody has huge anime eyes irl lol). the colors look different on different types of screens and i know this because some of my old work looks very vibrant on my new laptop and kinda washed out on a phone screen. it would be cool if people stopped bitching and let artists enjoy creating art. most fanart i do is usually unpaid work in my free time. with commissions i tell people to show me the exact color for skin, eyes and hair. i never had any complaints about how i draw poc. however, i don't like how artists are being treated. if you don't draw poc you are racist, if you do you are still racist because they are not dark enough. it's funny how it's perfectly ok to draw white chatacters as black, but if you make a black character a shade too light in a pastel style all hell breaks loose.

Neutral	they've always acted this way of course, but the far left has really gotten out of hand lately. much like the radical right most people just left of center increasingly seem to live inside their own dogma and the blinders are permanently up. the radical right is going to be emboldened by the left's behavior and i'm convinced there's no stopping it, it's like everyone lives in an opposing realities entirely.       i frame it this way because the right generally comes from a very human, flawed perspective that will never leave us entirely, whereas the necessary proggressive side of humanity represented by the left has attached itself by the roots to things the other side will never stand for. it shouldn't be this way.

Neutral	i agree that single-payer would be terrible.  the thing is that most universal healthcare systems are not single payer  and they aren't free  at the point of service.  i have actually handled marketing for healthcare in three other countries and can say that it can actually work rather well if it is set up prudently.  i will try to dig up the oecd data, but i found that wait times are actually not worse in multiplayer systems than the united states. however, they are considerably worse in single payer systems. more specifically, i used to  handle digital marketing for a major private health insurance company in australia.  over there, 50% of people have private health insurance. there are a couple of reasons for this. first of all, the tax system over there actually incentivizes middle-class and rich people to purchase private health insurance. the goal is to make sure that the public system is mostly being used by people that have no other alternative. this reduces the problems  that would lead to rationing  and unsustainable cost increases, as you correctly pointed out.  plus, people that are willing to pay for a private system are going to get higher quality care, which should absolutely be their right.        also, the australian government requires people to pay something like 15% of the bill every time they get a service. this is a necessary element to keep people from going to the hospital every time they have a stomachache. it helps keep costs in check and bottlenecking the system so people have to wait forever.        single-payer system would actually be horrible. the only country i'm aware of that has the single-payer system liberals seem to talk about is canada. they have the worst weight times and one of the worst rated healthcare systems outside the united states.

Neutral	i've been one of these people. sometimes, you just gotta get these feelings out to someone. even if it's anonymous strangers on the internet, you just gotta get it out. writing it in a journal doesn't work because there's this desperate feeling for someone to know that you're suffering, while also such an intense shame and guilt about it that you can't tell your family or friends. so [USER] gets a post.       at least in my experience, advice or sympathy don't really help and just make me feel worse. i feel the need to argue against it and say "well i've tried that and it didn't work" or shit like that, but feel like such a dick arguing against wellmeaning people that i just don't respond and end up deleting the post a few hours later anyway.       so just don't take it personally. a lot of times folks (or at least me) don't have an outlet and will spew their guts out to the internet because it's better than keeping it in. we aren't looking for advice or sympathy, there's just a depression/anxiety demon whispering in your ear and it often gets so loud that you just need to uncork your feelings to relieve a little pressure. that doesn't mean the effort isn't appreciated.

PersonDirectedAbuse	was a little more severe than that, tbh. the soviet population wasn't very fond of stalin, and had the germans not been as harsh as they were, they likely could have turned the soviet population on stalin.      stalin actually thought the war was over.      > at 3.30 a.m. on 22 june 1941 the chief of the red army general staff, georgi zhukov, telephoned stalin's dacha to rouse the soviet leader from his sleep. the germans, he told him, had begun shelling red army positions along the frontier. stalin refused to believe that a full-scale invasion was under way. surely, he told a small gathering of civilian and military leaders in moscow later in the morning, hitler did not know about it. there must be a conspiracy among the leaders of the german armed forces. it was only when the german ambassador, count friedrich werner von der schulenburg, met foreign minister molotov in the kremlin to hand over the german declaration of war that stalin recognized he had been duped by hitler. initially shocked, embarrassed and disoriented, stalin soon pulled himself together. on 23 june 1941 he worked at his desk in the kremlin from 3.20 in the morning to 6.25 in the evening, gathering information and making the necessary arrangements for the creation of a supreme command to take charge of operations. as the days went by, he became increasingly dispirited by the scale and speed of the german advance. at the end of june, he left for his dacha, saying, in his inimitably coarse way, 'everything's lost. i give up. lenin founded our state and we've fucked it up.' he made no address to the soviet people, he did not talk to his subordinates, he did not even answer the phone. german planes, indeed, dropped leaflets over the red army lines claiming that he was dead. when a delegation from the politburo arrived at the dacha, they found stalin slumped in an armchair. 'why have you come?' he asked. with a thrill of terror, two members of the delegation, mikoyan and beria, realized he thought they had come to arrest him.      and gave the famous speech, rallying the soviet population behind him.      > within a few days of retreating to his dacha in despair, stalin recovered his nerve, if indeed he had really lost it. some thought he had retreated into temporary isolation like ivan the terrible centuries before, to demonstrate his indispensability. a state defence committee was set up, with stalin himself in the chair. his retreat had given him the chance to rethink his role. on 3 july 1941, the same day that franz halder confided to his diary his belief that victory had already been achieved by the german forces, stalin spoke to the soviet people over the radio, for the first time not as communist dictator but as patriotic leader. 'brothers and sisters,' he said, 'friends!' this was an entirely new note. he went so far as to admit that the red army had been unprepared for the attack. the germans, he said, were 'wicked and perfidious . . . heavily armed with tanks and artillery'. but they would not prevail. the soviet people had to organize civil defence and mobilize every ounce of energy to defeat the enemy. it was necessary to form partisan groups behind the lines to cause as much damage and disruption as possible. silence, lies and evasion, people felt, had at last been replaced with some kind of truth. communist party propaganda began to emphasize the defence not of the revolution but of the motherland. the party newspaper, pravda ('truth'), dropped the slogan 'workers of the world, unite!' from its masthead and replaced it with 'death to the german invaders!' nikolai moskvin noted on 30 september 1941 that 'the mood of the local population has changed sharply'. from constantly threatening to betray him to the germans, they came round to the patriotic cause after learning that the occupation authorities were keeping the collective farms going because it made it easier to collect the grain for transporting back to germany.      > the speech's patriotic appeal was all the more powerful because people were already beginning to learn the bitter realities of german occupation. stories of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps mingled with eyewitness reports of the mass shooting of civilians and the burning of villages by german troops to produce in the still-retreating ranks of the red army a determination to fight the enemy that had been almost entirely absent in the first chaotic days of the war. when the city of kursk fell, the germans arrested all the healthy male inhabitants, penned them into open barbed-wire enclosures without food or water, and then put them to work, guarded by germans wielding rubber truncheons. 'the streets are empty,' noted a soviet intelligence report. 'the shops have been looted. there is no mains water and no electricity. kursk has collapsed.'

Neutral	attacking iran. fake news about a terrorist connection could serve as a pretext for war                    there are foundations in washington, all closely linked to israel and its lobby in the u.s., that are wholly dedicated to making the case for war against iran. they seek pretexts in various dark corners, including claims that iran is cheating on its nuclear program, that it is developing ballistic missiles that will enable it to deliver its secret nuclear warheads onto targets in europe and even the united states, that it is an oppressive, dictatorial government that must be subjected to regime change to liberate the iranian people and give them democracy, and, most stridently, that is provoking and supporting wars and threats against u.s. allies all throughout the middle east.      dissecting the claims about iran, one might reasonably counter that rigorous inspections by the united nations international atomic energy agency (iaea) confirm that tehran has no nuclear weapons program, a view that is supported by the u.s. intelligence community in its recent worldwide threat assessment. beyond that, iran's limited missile program can be regarded as largely defensive given the constant threats from israel and the u.s. and one might well accept that the removal of the iranian government is a task best suited for the iranian people, not delivered through military intervention by a foreign power that has been starving the country through economic warfare. and as for provoking wars in the middle east, look to the united states and israel, not iran.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	you know what? fuck this dumb fucking platform (reddit). anything political on reddit is such a fucking waste of time, every place is a massive echochamber. worst thing is the default subreddits that pretend to be neutral that have a clear libtard bias. the whole voting system that burries comments is annoying too. the number of times i had to sort by controversial to get a good opinion is too damn high.    at this point even going on 4chan is way better than this shitty mess. the reddit groupthink is so annoying when you say something remotely controversial or offensive you get downvoted or banned into oblivion.      at least the 4chan faggots don't pretend to be some sort of moral authority all the time.
Neutral	that's what a moderated sub looks like. the top comments had no sources to back up their claims, so they were removed. would you rather have misinformation or no information?
Neutral	mostly agree, but...       my parents occasionally ask me, the internet expert, where to find things. "have you googled it yet?" is a question that frequently prompts them to go solve their own problem. frequently better then i would have because i don't know exactly why they need it.       they just lived too long in the pre-internet era to reflexively think of google as the oracle of all knowledge and products. to them, knowledge lives in humans or books.

Neutral	i was tripping on mushrooms when i was in my early 20s with a friend of mine. we were sitting back to back on a chat pile surrounded by trees and discussing higher powers and aliens. there was a flash of purple-pink light, like lightning, but not a cloud in the sky. i figured i was tripping pretty hard so didn't say anything, but my buddy leaned back against me and whispered, "what the fuck was that?"       when we both acknowledged the flash, the woods around the chat pile started rustling without wind or animals visible in the dark. we both stood up, waiting for something to happen or approach. as quickly as the sounds started, the woods went completely silent and we sprinted to his car. we figured taking our chances on the road was a better alternative to whatever was happening in the woods.       i don't pretend to know what happened, but we both experienced it.
Neutral	my friend responded this when i showed this pic to him:      >guys, first. that's not that light a skintone. i've seen these characters, this isn't that far off. second, pastel! people tend to go with lighter tones in pastels. third, **stop obsessing over skintones you racist filth!**      >i mean, what is this?

Neutral	one problem is, we're essentially not given the information (and not allowed) to discuss this in contrast with the number of police interactions that go perfectly legally and safely.  just like in every other group of humans given power, some will abuse that power.  that doesn't mean we don't need to weed them out, but if you only focus on the bad interactions and ignore the good ones, regardless of what the ratio is, it's *always* going to look like you have an epidemic of police violence.  considering that's what drives clicks and ad revenue, i don't expect that style of reporting to ever change.

Neutral	i think this is a thought nobody is going to let go of until a few more years pass. awareness is very lacking for many things, going from rape arguments to differences in how depression and confessions of feelings are treated (for example a woman confessing for needing help often receives a different treatment from everyone nearby her compared to a male that is mocked for his weakness or kind of receiving a disgusted reaction, especially by the opposite gender).           i have received more or less the same answers you received, although in my case it was always forceful molestation. there is still this underlying thought from men that mostly see the other sex as a chance to be sexual with rather than human beings first, but not when without them, mostly with strangers or friends or acquaintances. i think in a few years things will change, and hopefully the awareness of rape being a general problem, depression and sadness being top priorities to fight along obesity as cause of death, will progress once and for all.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	womens rights basically. until the baby has exited the body they want the right to kill it instead.
Neutral	yeah, and it's arguments like this one that really underscore how morally bankrupt the pro-corporate position is. you people went from "corporations can't take away your rights because only governments can do that" to "everything corporations take from you isn't a right, so stop complaining"

Neutral	i sure do think there may be 'prettier' ways to call it, but it's gender dysphoria anyway and the more we use that term, the more people get used to it.      while i don't disagree with what you said i do think being bisexual is different than having down's syndrome. being bisexual is a sexuality, not a mental disorder, while down's is a mental disorder. harsh as it may be for some.

Neutral	no one wants to date the "sick girl."      and i know what you're thinking:      no! that's not true!    there is someone for everyone.    it's not like you're contiguous.      just shut up and listen. it's not that simple. it's never that simple.       dating the sick girl means committing to non-commitment. plans will be ruined, or more likely cancelled. travel is rare or just completely out of the question. dating the sick girl means put a ton of blood, sweat and tears into someone who might not even have a future. it means a lot of days sitting alone on the couch while she naps in the bedroom. it means being taken care of, even though it feels silly, because she understands how fragile the human body can be and she doesn't want to lose you. because you mean everything to her.      and she's not a passing fancy, or a charity case. she doesn't want your pity. she is not interested in a fleeting romance. so much of her life is fleeting, over before it starts. she's only interested in a solid lasting connection, it's something that is so very precious to her because the concrete often feels so out of reach for someone who lives with what she does.        it's hard. it's not easy. it's not always fun.       and i know what you're thinking:      no relationship is perfect.   all relationships have problems.      shut the fuck up because those problems are pretty fucking small in comparison to what comes with dating a sick girl. you don't get it unless you've lived through it. but even then you don't fucking get it because you're not her. you don't feel what she feels. you don't see all of her pain because she hides it from you, because she cares about you and wants to protect you.      and you can't protect her, and it's devastating. you can't protect her, and it makes you feel weak and useless. it starts to eat at you deep down, and it festers there until you can't take it anymore and then you do what seemed unimaginable.      you leave her.       and her heart breaks as it has every time before. she feels abandoned, alone and lost. she lost her rock. and it kills her inside, because she gets why you left, but she is also so angry because you don't fucking get it.       all she needed was for you to be her rock.   solid.   concrete.      and now she's left again with no one to lean on.      because no one wants to date the sick girl.      edit: i'm honestly not interested in any unsolicited "advice".  the information provided is not even substantial enough for any unsolicited advice to even be remotely useful anyway. so if you're feeling the impulse do yourself a favor and keep it to yourself and not make yourself look like an asshole. you're welcome.      this was a rant. an expression of frustration and not meant to be any kind of discussion or condemnation of anyone.       honestly it's kind of ridiculous that i have to explain that.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	why nz is trying to silence media. the truth is that it has turned into a tird world enriched shithole country. but why oh why?      nz itself is crazyshit. you gotta keep them asset prices inflated 1 million dollars for a shitty drafty moldy "house" why? that's the enrichment our 300 000 a year immigration (ie welfare for banks) policy gives us writing this as i sit in traffic so why? well listen to me you fucking peon fucks. there are two solutions. 1) cheaper debt 2) more buyers there's a slight possibility that they will let a few markets/developers slide just to show everyone they "mean business" and to try and prove to the world, and to themselves, that we have a "robust" and "diversified" economy built on sound foundations. but in reality there's nothing else of substance in our economy other than debt secured against house prices which are in turn inflated by that very debt. and thousands of hairdressers, baristas and imported furniture retailers taped together to look like an industry. its fairly important that we protect these economic foundations as much as possible. the debt machine can never falter! interest rates to be slashed again! foreign investor restrictions to be lifted! the real unemployment rate is around 20% in terms of underemployment its even higher. teaching grads cleaning toilets, nursing grads mowing lawns, science grads working at big w. in 2008 the us, uk and others stopped accepting garbage students. we didn't. in fact, we and nz opened our borders to them. they couldn't get into the us and uk, so they came here - the path of least resistance. they let in the anyone for a degree, now they let in the foreign people with the primary school visa. next they will just let in anyone with a child here. universities, primary schools (and high schools - they will stay) and soon kindergardens. why? banks can't find fresh meat to borrow to. the men have all borrowed. then the women have all borrowed. the final class of people who could borrow were "students" and third world immigrants (same venn circle) and aussie and nz students who wouldn't have been let into a tafe 30 years ago are now getting into medicine, law, engineering and arts. the banks need this fresh meat. but it's not enough because it's drying up. so now they want the kids to borrow. i see it now the kindergarden visa! all the parents, guardians and kids need to borrow money to buy a house, and get that education. the banks need it! i study economics. most of you don't study economics. i study it at a top university in brisbane. you don't. you're not as good as me, and you probably went to shitburb state high. i didn't, i went to brissie state high. i'm one of the big boys, the elites, the best of the fucking best, like i'm already number 1 so why try harder best of the best. you fucks don't understand anything. you have no control, you fucking peons. banks are gonna hire me, and banks are fucking king. you are not. banks in australia and nz lend money to people for property investment, because that is how they make money. raking in the interest payments. in order to justify current valuations, property prices (read: debt) must increase by 10% yearly, forever. the banks (read: our entire economy) therefore need property prices/debt to increase 10% yearly, forever. it's not even a question of "risk", the banks are absolutely reliant on something that is completely impossible except that it's not as you will see if you can read this you dummies. the banks will delay the reckoning at literally at any cost. you don't fucking count. if you did count, and you wanted it to stop, it would result in a complete rethink of our society, not to mention collapsing property prices, stock prices, pension plans. our entire economic system now relies on using debt to inflate asset prices at a higher rate than underlying cash flows you dumb fucks. if we even try to stop this, then hundreds of thousands of people employed by banks would have to find actually productive jobs that simply no longer exist in australia or nz people (you and your fellow dumb fucking peon fucks) would find they own but a fraction of the wealth they thought they did, and millions would be entirely wiped out. people would be scrounging around for food, eating rats, cats, dogs, and even at those shitty greasy spoon chinese restaurants, growing and scrounging for food everywhere they could, and resuming normal personal body weight not seen in australia/nz since the 1960s. tradesmen would be struggling to put petrol in their utes, and would be begging anyone with cash to take their 5 year old ute off of their hands — no second ute and no new utes and no utes at all and no webers and no more properties. weekend get togethers would be devoid of talk about the number of properties people have, and how much foreign booze they drank last week, and how many european holidays they had last fucking month. and millionaire landed gentry boomers need their fucking welfare. there are about 2.5 million australians / nzers on welfare receiving the full (or partial) age pension of which 2.26 million (90%) are home owners. a couple can enjoy the full age pension if they have assets under $286,500 and a partial pension up to $1,145,000 excluding the value of the family home. the full age pension for a couple if $33,500 a year without factoring in the pbs benefits, discounted rates and utilities, discounted car registration and so on. the bottom line? the political-majority is enormously incentivized to remain in the houses on quarter-acre blocks they bought 20/30/40/50 years ago for < 3x annual income. they have no reason to sell up and downsize to release equity to generate income or reverse mortgage their homes. do not underestimate the effect this has on supply availability and prices. so we can't let it happen. if that means we need an extra 5 million to 50 million chneese/idians/me here, so be it. 43 m new chneese and idians are born every and each year if that means you will be drinking beer at the pub within earshot of 5 million chneese/me/idians eating noodles and shitting on piss stained footpaths, then so be it. the 10% growth must continue. live with it and fucking deal with it and fucking realise you fucking are a fucking peon you fucking dumb fucking fucks! i'm one semester from getting my bachelor of economics and you are a bunch of fucking peon dumb fucking fucks. nz looks like dehli and changsha mixed together. even sister teresa the nun would be shocked if she visited.      keep this up because my career as a asset price inflater banker depends on it thank you

Neutral	while the post is a bit silly, i wonder what would be the ratio of people hearing voices or with multiple personality disorder being portrayed as evil/creepy vs portrayed as victims in films? of course film makers are just trying to make money, but stereotypes like these can lead to stigmatization i think      having said all that, asylums are creepy because of the fucked up things that happened in the past - the horrific treatments. in the same way that a "ancient burial ground" would be considered creepy. an old asylum would feel like it must be cursed in the same way the torture chamber in the tower of london seems like it should be creepy.

Neutral	it will be exciting when you do get to the stage of being able to move out that will be like a new chapter for you it's something to look forward too! if i'm not mistaken there are websites that people advertise their places to rent out rooms designed specifically for college students  not on campuses just random people advertising i've looked into it before for my country, so pretty much you would be sharing a place with other people but you have your own space ofc with people who r in college as well which could be a good thing to look into not just for the moving out aspect but you also could make some friends idk.       i'm glad to hear she did at least try and can see he went way way over the top. maybe try talking with her 1 on 1 so maybe since she has experienced similar feelings in the past she would be more understanding of your perspective and how serious it is and that you do need support.       a few comments said that you need to cut ties the toxicity in your life but at the moment that is more or less impossible and would cause too much grief for you and they are a part of your support network and that's something that is important to have (a support network) and maintain. i think your dad is just confused and doesn't know how to handle just mental health on a whole maybe having a heart to hear with your mum could help her help him to learn more about this kinda stuff so he can help you because i'm sure all he wants is to help you but just doesn't know how to, and maybe he is struggling aswell and just doesn't know it properly sand doesn't currently have the mental capacity needed to take proper care of you. there are so many things that could have attributed to his his actions that have nothing to do with you and could be a case of poorly directed and understood emotions, has he been under any stress or pressure at work?, unexpected bills, a loss of a loved wrong?, problems at home or job security? , or maybe him seeing you at the age you are taking steps into college has him thinking of the past or whatever and that's gotten him down(like him not being where he'd like to be in life idk i'm not a councillor). idk sorry you said like everything was lovely before so i'm trying to think about what could be the underling cause for why he reacted in such a horrible way, i'm sure he regrets what he said and feels bad for it. i hope he does. and i hope he will come around soon and acknowledge what he said and apologises to you. sorry i hope you get what i'm trying to say.      but above all you need to look out for you and trying to protect your mental state is most important so if that means asap moving out work towards what you have to do to achieve that so you can at least get that space to become level headed which in turn will help you be able to feel better. and hopefully fix and build a healthy relationship with your dad if you do decide that it is something you want.          it will be hard, you will have feelings to end it all, you will want to give up and it will feel pointless. but i promise you that it won't be worth it. you will struggle your entire life. everyone does in their own way that's just the sad 'shitty' fact of life. but as life goes on you build experience of dealing with the shit life throws at ya and get better at coping with your thoughts and feelings and someday in the future you will be faced with a problem and then think back and think to yourself "wow if x was a problem 2 years ago that would have been enough to make me tie the rope there and then. but it's a problem now and i'm okay". and that's something you will be happy to acknowledge that you have progressed in yourself and all the suffering we go through conditions us to who we are going to be in the future like for example if in the future you become a parent i have no doubt you will be a amazingly supportive and loving parent because you will understand what it's like to feel certain feelings.      sorry i'm on phone so terrible formatting and what not i truly hope for the best for you op please take care of yourself and i hope you can see what i'm trying to say please let me know if there is something i said that doesn't make sense or worded wrong. if you find yourself needing someone to talk to feel free to msg me i'm happy to talk.      edit: fuck i typed a lot sorry
Neutral	so the other day i was getting a jianbingguozi at a stall in front of my school，out of the corner of my eye i saw something familiar - a lush straw-like mess growing on a barely existing neck. this can only mean one thing - i'm not the only one here anymore.      i turned around to look. he saw me but pretended not to. he continued to walk straight into the front entrance to ***my*** school, barely noticing the scent eminating from the side wall, which i sprayed with my pungent urine the other day to demarcated my territory.      in the following days i noticed a marked change in the demeanor of those around me: i was no longer getting the stares i used to, my students don't say i'm handsome anymore, the jianbingguozi ayi no longer skip the chilli sauce for me and even the milf at the massage parlor don't give me discount for happy ending anymore.      it is all because of him. i must get rid of him.      now gemerz, give me some ideas how i can get rid of him without bringing too much suspicion on to myself? my budget is about 1000 yuan and i am prepare to do anything. ***anything***.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	>"if you tweet about trans suicides but not christian persecution in the middle east, you are christphobic."      said nobody ever because not every group is petty enough to come up with stupid "-phobic" words and demand that everyone be passionate about the things they're passionate about.      just using christians as an example, but there are plenty of groups who are just as oppressed as these sjws claim to be and yet you don't see them pulling this crap because they're just not as whiny. i'm also specifically bringing up christian persecution in the middle east because it's the type of thing that these people would be tweeting about if it were about a group that's higher on the intersectional heirarchy, which christians rank very low on.

Neutral	well what about plan b in the next couple days? you can buy that anywhere now and its cheap      or at least have an abortion in the first few weeks. even all of these so called "heartbeat" abortion bills still allow abortion in the first 4-6 weeks i believe      a person would literally have to make "mistakes" everyday for a couple months to end up with an unwanted baby. even then you still have adoption as an option

Neutral	  edit: you'll have to go to ceddit or removedreddit to get the original.      original pic/allegation. there was another pic with it claiming that they "wrote it out to vent" they "didn't mean it" amd "accidentally hit send" and "if you need anything to call us [them]". i'm obviously paraphrasing, but there you go.      [URL]         this is wonky as hell. all anyone has by way of proof are 2 screenshots and ops word. supposedly the ceo (or whatever, unsure if his title) answered in the thread- sort by controversial and it's like 3-10 comments down- but he *seems to* talk quite similar to op.       i'm not saying that it's 100% that the op is lying but this looks, sounds, and **feels** really off to me and i think it bears watching. though it may not matter as they're review bombing the business (and review bombing the wrong business location in some cases).that's super important as these are franchises, they don't own all the businesses that have that name. they've also ran them off almost every single social media platform they're active on.      fwiw i've reported to the mods and they got back to me quickly and told me they'd take care of it. (i sent a pm w my report) im trying to message the admins but i'm on the reddit app and i'm unsure how to do that, or if there's even a "contact admins" button. i can't really blame the mods if they didn't know it was going on and that thread if a mammoth, it's huge.          thoughts? feelings? ideas? am i way off?      edit: a user claimed after they left their (fraudulent) review the store answered with this statement. obviously made a while ago but i just missed it. they state a disgruntled ex employee hacked their insta and sent this. **my personal opinion** is that he "hacked" their insta (aka guessed the password) and did this himself. "none would dare oppose us! muh hahahahahahahaha *twists handlebar mustache*" is a little too much for me.      as you can see i'm quite interested in this!         (not directly linking or cross posting to avoid brigading, witch hunts, and harassment (as if that's not already going on) or *accusations of* brigading etc etc. too many subs being banned and quarantined and i can't imagine we're high up in reddits list of "advertiser friendly" subs.)

Neutral	could be. i think the point is that there's a lot of violence in the indigenous community specifically, disproportionately to the population numbers, and this movement is part of the effort to shine a light on that.      and yes, the discussion often seems to largely exclude indigenous men, and many times (especially when it's non-native people talking) seems to ignore the reasons for violence *within* the communities.      however, there do seem to be people taking an honest approach to things, like this guy.      i don't know, and i'm also not canadian and don't know much about the details to be honest. but it does sort of seem like a good thing to ask the question about why these communities in general suffer from so much more violence (within their walls and not), and i'm not sure that asking that would make someone a racist.       what do you think?

Neutral	is the alternative to just make every born person the same shade of near-black? the in-game assets look different from the ow comics as well. are blizzard artists not aware of how their own characters look or something? this is just such a weak fucking complaint. they're clearly brown. what difference would it make if they were light brown or dark brown?       i'd agree with thos argument if they literally made them white, but the skin tone is still correct. i'm so sorry that artists have different styles. if you're displeased with how a character was drawn by someone, literally nothing is stopping your from drawing it yourself in the way you like it.       like, i don't get why people feel the need to police other people's art. if you want vanta black poc, fucking draw it. if you want it to look like the official work, go play overwatch or read the official comics. one person posting their own pastel-style rendering of the characters doesn't change the fact that the characters have an established model.       overwatch is probably the most diverse game on the market and it literally is never enough for these people. at this point, blizz is almost forced to release a queer black trans person next because it's just about the only thing they haven't done.

IdentityDirectedAbuse$Slur	meanwhile i'm legitimately sitting here, in the southern us right now with a white woman asleep next to me. we go out in public together (gasp), i work from home doing my relatively high-income software pmo director job where i have a few dozen white employees in my department, i own my condo and car, i went to the gun range last week for some practice with the firearms i *own*, i went to law school, and i voted in november.      but yeah it's *super* racist in the south. basically just like the civil war. you know, the civil war in the 1860s when i was considered property *owned* by someone, couldn't vote, looking at a white woman would've been grounds for the general community to kill me to say nothing of sleeping with one on a regular basis, owning property would've been *hilariously* challenging, and for me to be in possession of a firearm would've been (again) grounds to probably kill me. pretty sure *knowing how to read* was illegal for black people for awhile, and voting? haha... no. i think i was still 3/5ths of a person back then.      these people piss me off because they're denigrating the actual racism my grandparents actually lived through. the klan walked the streets while sweeping democratic gun laws stopped my grandparents from owning firearms to protect themselves and their children (my father) and they got poll taxes and literacy tests at the polls removed *in their lifetime*- to say nothing of desegregation.      like what the fuck? where do these people live that they think anywhere south of the mason-dixon is somehow some backwater redneck hick town? atlanta is in the south- the headquarters of their beloved cnn. so is charlotte, raleigh-durham, miami, knoxville, charleston, savannah and a dozen other major metro areas.      the worst part of it all is that these people remind me more of slaveowners than 'progressives'- every slave master thought they were doing black people a favor: we were godless heathens so they put us to work, gave us a place to sleep and food to eat, and "civilized the negro". hey guys, guess what? if i was being subjected to anything resembling systemic civil war-era racism in the south, i'd pick my black ass up and get the fuck out. i haven't, so either these people think i'm a *massive idiot* incapable of taking care of myself, or they're pushing a false narrative knowingly.      or both.

Slur	recently a guy messaged me on social media and we started talking and we don't message each other that much,  but when we do it feels really natural and not forced at all and that's a really rare thing for me,  because i have troubles talking to new people.       but my brain is a stupid fucking bitch and goes from zero to hundred real quick. i create all this scenarios in my head where i meet this guy (and jfc, it can go as far as a dating scenario) and it's taking a toll on my mental health.        like when we don't talk it is making me really upset because it doesn't go with the fantasy i came up with (i don't even understand how that happens,  it is almost like my brain's natural response to liking someone).        i also get really obsessive,  like i go through his social media 5 hundred times a day.  i recognize that this is very unhealthy behaviour,  but it almost feels like i have no control over it.        it is so exhausting and it is making me think that i don't actually deserve new relationships because obviously my own problems are going to affect other people and i don't want to be a burden for anybody.
Neutral	i've met some insane cyclists before, like just rage-a-holic people with no ability to de-escalate. everything they do, including disregarding safety and rules of the road is fine, but anything you do is wrong and boy howdy they will let you have it.      those kinds of people exist and drive cars too, but there's 1000x more of them in cars, and cars can easily kill you. so i'm not super worried about the first group. if a cyclist is so mad they want to hurt me, i'll just drive away, or stay in my car or whatever. if a driver wants to hurt me they can kill people.

Neutral	not to raise an argument for an all beef diet (why you would choose beef over chicken breast or fish, which are infinitely more healthy is beyond me), but there's at least some merit to a low-carb diet, mostly because it tends to just knock out your appetite making it easier to consume less calories.       i think the big thing about fruit is while it is good for you, it tends to tack on more sugar to the already sugar heavy american diet. if you're woofing down a syrup-laden dole fruit cup after some chicken nuggets and a coke, you're hardly doing yourself any favors.        the cheese and egg thing, they're just really low in carbs according to google. usually low carb diets keep you at like 30-35g of carbs a day, and you'd have to eat over a dozen boiled eggs in day to come close to that. not that you'd want all that cholesterol anyway.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	jesus christ, shut the fuck up you snivelling gobshite.      i'm not about to get into some kind of anti-dick measuring contest over who's had less sex but suffice it to say i know a thing or two about loneliness, and this whole spiel is fucking offensive. in all my time spent in a darkened room listening to hank williams, i've never felt like i needed or even wanted to sexually harass or assault a woman. that is not a natural male response to loneliness. if it's your natural response, **it is because you are a cunt.** this shite is far more misandrist than anything i tend to hear feminists saying. you're trying to drag our whole gender down to your level, saying *this is just how men are*, rather than do a fucking microsecond of self-reflection to try and bring yourself up.      there are plenty of reasonable and well-adjusted men who haven't had most luck in relationships/dating, and a lot of them worry if they're open about feeling down about it they might be associated with psycho fuck incel nonsense like this, so congratulations on making things harder for pretty much everyone.       >it sucks that *you feel like* you're being harassed / **whatever but**...      fucking stunning display of empathy there, mate. for a second i almost believed this wasn't just an attempt to seem like you're being reasonable and considering both sides before dumping a bunch of drivel about how women being harassed is totally okay.      your whole comment is dishonest, childish, selfish, and fucking whingy. i don't like judging people's whole personality from a single reddit comment, but if you act like this all the time, that might be why you're not getting your hole. get a grip.

Neutral	eh, i think there's a slightly different factor to this case.      as has been pointed out many times over the past few years - it's pretty strange that 'the highest grossing film of all time by far' is a one-off oddity from 2009 whose story and characters had almost no cultural impact. people struggle to remember the names of almost any character in the film, there are no memorable quotes from it in the pop cultural lexicon, no scenes or plot concepts getting referenced or homaged, nobody walking around in avatar t-shirts, etc. compare it to star wars, lord of the rings, harry potter, marvel, e.t., jaws, titanic, batman, frozen, or any other cultural and financial *phenomenon*, and its content is a total obscurity. even shrek and pirates of the carribean had a way bigger pop culture impact, for their first couple films anyway.      point being, it's rubbed a lot of people the wrong way that the highest grossing movie in the entire 100-year history of the medium has, for a decade now, been one that's significant almost entirely for a camera gimmick. even other films like the wizard of oz, star wars and jurassic park which are similarly famous for their gamechanging technological breakthroughs *also* had iconic stories, characters and dialogue which have long outlasted the novelty of their sfx.      an avengers film *finally* topping avatar at the box office feels more like a victory for common sense than brand loyalty, because the *content* of the marvelverse has had all the ubiquitous cultural impact that avatar lacked, and it's nice to know that more human beings have connected with something like that, than just been roped into going to the theater for some 3d hype alone.       a world where avengers, not avatar, is society's highest grossing movie of all time is a world that makes a little more sense to everybody, in a time in desperate need of that.

Neutral	     using a throwaway account now. i had been depressed lately ever since i started my winter quarter of college as a first year. i am now currently a sophomore year going into junior year.      i grew up with engineering drilled into my brain. my dad is an engineer, and as a little kid i always solve problems, create new objects with lego pieces, and always wondered how cars work. i excelled in many math and science tests until starting middle school when i moved into a bit more average.      i then entered a top tier engineering school under an engineering program. i quickly realized how much i hated chemistry and barely scrapped by with a d in both calculus 3 (taylor series, sequences, etc...) and chemistry ii, got into academic probation. i then switched into another form of engineering, bumped my gpa up with easy classes just to get out of academic probation, then got into academic probation again after failing statics with a f. i honestly feel very annoyed.      i'm now sitting in my house during spring break thinking engineering isn't right for me. i literally have no drive to do well in classes anymore. i hate going back to school, rather irritated each time i have to go back. i hate the constant going to class, sitting in there listening to pointless bullshit, then getting out. i hate the constant homework that is being thrown at me. the thing i hate most? tests. why do we have to memorize all of pointless math and others? i don't know which other major i can be interested at.      most people i'm around with are rather shitty, or i just don't fit in with them. i am losing multiple friends back in home, and i'm not making any true friends in college. i'm always open to hanging out, but it's always like this: "i'm busy, sorry." or some version of that. or they just don't respond at all. i always have nothing to do rather than playing video games instead of seeing all other people going to college parties with their super close group of friends. i also got made fun of for driving a manual transmission vehicle that i bought, because it was cheap and reliable, but at least i have a freaking car to use, right?      why do i have to be that kid who peaked in high school? back then when i had a girlfriend, was a sports team captain, always have fun stuff to do. now i'm just sitting here with a low gpa and have not exercised in so long because of engineering work.      i'm fucking irritated. i've been noticing i got angry a lot easier, especially after getting back test scores when all i want to do is to yell "fuck engineering" in my brain. why can't i just get my shit together? i hate being one of the least smartest students in class, but i loathe almost every single math and science courses i take. i loathe calculus and linear analysis. i loathe all physics, chemistry, and biology. why did i let gpa dictate my happiness? and otherwise, why the hell do most jobs have this 3.0 gpa minimum required? it's a very stupid requirement to have, just seeing all those people who cheated their way being eligible for that job.      feel free to ask me any more questions.

Neutral	dude i type long ass comments too it's okay      yeah i'm still trying to figure out if he actually meant what he said. i know he's been super stressed lately and he's upset with a lot of things in his life and i feel like he might just have directed that towards me. i'm not trying to defend him but i can understand where he's coming from. he doesn't really have a filter, especially when he's upset.       it's weird because he actually attempted suicide a couple times when he was younger so i thought he would be more understanding. but apparently his reasons were more significant than mine so mine aren't as important or some shit.       i'm so conflicted because he's actually not that bad of a parent and i want to be able to talk to him but sometimes he just goes so over the top acting like such a narc. he did a lot of things right while raising me but this is just a lot to deal with now. ugh i feel like a lot would be fixed if i just didn't live with him. our relationship and my mental state would probably improve a lot but i can't yet.

Neutral	amen. there have always been plenty of geeks of every gender and sexual orientation you can name (trans people have always been especially well represented - although it was not as openly discussed in the past and people were often closeted, so it may have not appeared that way at the time) and geeks of every color, creed, culture, etc.       the issue i see is more one of commercialization/banalization, of trendiness - something approaching cultural appropriation (i know a lot of people hate that parallel, but i feel it's true at least to an extent.) a certain well-known faux-scandal (whose name i refuse to use because it's obnoxious and stupid) and similar bigoted nonsense has unfortunately rendered discussion of the topic rather taboo in progressive circles, as people assume you're going to say something misogynist or otherwise hateful, instead of simply expressing dismay that your niche/interests have been "gentrified" by people just following the latest trend.

Neutral	you're welcome. as for the quantifier of 'harmless,' that's also subjective and given the implications, you're likely to find you're at odds with whoever's beliefs you disagree with.       one thing to keep in mind is most, while open to discussions on many topics, are trying to maintain some semblance of anonymity and that includes not going into descriptions of things they might've experienced. when personal experience is a contributing factor for someone's beliefs, it's that much more unlikely they're going to be open to having their beliefs shifted.       otherwise, live and let live. you probably wouldn't like it if people that didn't share your beliefs were always trying to get you to think the same way they do every time you encountered them. it's probable it'd quickly reach the point where you're closed off to what they're saying. there's a ginormous difference in having a discussion vs arguing to change another's beliefs.

Neutral	yeah, i've noticed a lot of people just mindlessly saying "we need herd immunity" whenever someone asks why they care so much and that they / their children will be safe if they are vaccinated.      it isn't meant to prevent absolutely everyone from infection. that is almost impossible to do. it is to prevent epidemics by limiting the diseases ability to spread. it's just fairly simple maths really; each person comes into contact with, say, 20 people each day. those people also come into contact with 20 people. if 19 out of 20 people are immune and the risk of transmission is, for example, 50% then (with other factors like incubation period etc) you can predict the spread of the disease.

Neutral	idk, i tend to think that anyone who refers to women as "females" is kinda creepy because the only dudes who tend to do that are incels, redpillers, and mgtowers who want to dehumanize women because they hate them.  but that's just my personal experience talking.
Neutral	i mean he's not wrong. a lot of the complaints i see on here about redditors and reddit apply to this sub and it's subscribers as well.

Neutral	people need proof because all of these people who claim to be spokesmen for pocs (something i certainly don't appreciate. we can speak for ourselves) make outrageous claims that can't be proven.      'one guy catcalled me at a street?" that means every guy that come across me on the street wants to rape me!" <-- this is how you sound.      privilege means that you have accessibility to things that many other people don't have. i will not deny that in history and even now it's probably easier for a white guy to get a job over a black guy. but you want to know why people believe this? because we have verifiable proof of pocs being barred entry from getting better jobs by racist assholes.      you can't just make the claim that a poor white guy is always going to have more privilege than a black man making 6 figures. that is simply not true in every case.

Neutral	usually long blue collar hours lead to soreness, muscle issues, and incidents on job sites which could end in injury.      i believe op is attempting to connecting work with peoples access to pain killers. overworked laborers are given painkillers so they can continue to work long hours and be 'functional'.      blue collar families are how the addiction first started spreading, now it's to the white collar families.

Neutral	white people think they're the same too now because they're predominantly from america. nobody hates the irish anymore or anyone of eastern european descent if their accent is american, but they haven't always even been considered white.       it's just factions coalescing. most of these brown people and black people were born here at this point, by far the majority were. they aren't indians or africans, they are americans and they are brown, or black. this has been how americans behave throughout history, beginning with white people, and we assimilate better than anyone.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	the mayos upset about this deserve way worse
Neutral	i know, it's a very dehumanizing term. it really is a collectivist mindset, black people aren't individuals, they don't have their own thoughts and feelings, they're just a bunch of mounds of flesh that all think the same. if i was black, i would be furious at these kinds of people.       i despise collectivism, it is the cancer killing modern society.

PersonDirectedAbuse	on october 14, 2018 the bbc panorama twitter account placed the following linked video on their twitter page. it features abul hameed yousef who is portrayed as the grieving father of twin children in syria. in may 2017 the same 'bereaved' father was portrayed in the same manner across the near entirety of western mainstream media. this post will provide evidence, screen captured from the facebook page of this individual, abdul hammed yousef, the subject of the bbc propaganda video, that proves he is not in actuality the way the bbc portrayed him to be but is instead an islamic jihadist/terrorist conducting operations against the syrian government.      link to bbc panorama video - (note smooth font and graphics, emotional music, the use of the children to pull at the viewers heartstrings. a portion of the video simply shows the subject walking around with his back to camera and providing the put-forth narrative. at the 49 second mark the white helmets are shown. this clarity of signal post will also include extensive evidence that the white helmets are also not as they are portrayed to be by the mainstream media but are instead also islamic jihadists and terrorists being employed as a propaganda ruse to carry out regime change operations in syria.)      bbc video at link , plus images and video proving so called bereaved father is indeed a terrorist promoted by the bbc as a hero.

Neutral	"throw those crutches away, hop ya bastard!"
Neutral	the issue isn't the people themselves, it's the environment allows fascists to feel comfortable to spread hateful propaganda because to them, they see the self-deprecating and feel welcome. not everybody falls for it, but enough do to the point they can use it as a breeding ground. this is literally how the far-left 4chan was overtaken by far-right nationalists.      it's a fact that the fandom is *far* too welcoming to the kinds of people who would, given the chance, shoot them dead. it's just a joke right? up until the point it's not. i'll change my tune when communities stop tolerating (hell, protecting) them. until then, i'm going to continue being critical of how they're allowing fascism to grow and spread within their community.

Neutral	yes! there are many proven theories that google is always recording and you can actually go into your google settings and listen to what's been recorded.    i went on a diet recently, and i went to search for an old soup recipe and my search bar already was suggesting dieting options before i even typed/ or searched anything like that. the only way it could have known is by listening to my verbal conversations with my roommates.    shits wild.

Neutral	i'm not saying it should ever be used to refer to real trans women. i just think that labeling a term as "offensive" when it's a niche hobbyist term, either in the weebweb or in porn, is a bit strange. i would say it is always offensive if you call someone who is lgbt a trap, but i would also say that if you were referring to "trap porn" or a "trap character" it isn't necessarily. context carries a lot of weight, and in the latter two contexts the people and/or characters are often male identifying

Neutral	there was a huge cyclist rights guy who biked along a county highway every day and fucked with the commute. he fucked up traffic by being a moving traffic jam that ate one lane because he was going 20 in a 40.      despite having a bike path nearby he insisted on his "equal right to the road". except for all the times he would suddenly jump on the sidewalk to catch a walking light or go around traffic.      which is exactly what he was doing when he ran into a tiny kia shitbox. he literally biked into the side of a car that was making a right turn because he jumped on the sidewalk and tried to use the crosswalk.       he survived relatively unharmed, but since then the police have damn near forced him to use the bike path.

Neutral	currently grading some exams. i see two exams that literally have identical answers for all the questions. the mistakes are identical and everything. what i really hate is that most of the answers are right. so one student probably knew how to do most of the exam and the other student copied. so if they get away with it they would get a good grade. the other proctors don't seem to care as much about cheating. i've seen some professors just be on their computer the whole time while students are taking the test. i mean, hello!! there are lots of cheaters at this university.              i want to see those cheaters punished and flunk the course. i informed the guy who's in charge of the course and said, listen, look at these two exams because i think they're cheating. what's also annoying is that when we grade we grade for all the different students taking the class, and there are lots of different professors teaching the same course. so i have no idea who the students are, i can just see their exams. i wish the professors were more hardcore about preventing cheating because way too many students get away with it.

Neutral	most subs on reddit forbid posting personal information.      the reason is because if 100s of people from a reddit sub start harassing people then reddit will get a name as a brigandage website and might face legal difficulties.

Neutral	i agree with you fundamentally, i start caring when it has a real effect outside of discourse. but it's worth keeping in mind that the real tangible effects stem from the public mindset. few people are going to, as an example, lose their job over a joke until it starts being seen as acceptable (or morally required) to fire people over jokes. when people start to rebel against reason, logic, and fact then it's only a matter of time until that mindset starts to affect action.

Neutral	a little story time. who's up for some context?!      this started a few years ago, when i was big into writing fanfic - something i'm trying to get myself back into eventually. i write for a fairly niche fandom; it's not *small,* but it's also not terribly active these days, either. i'd made a few acquaintances through it, either way.      one of these was a woman roughly my age - let's call her "jill." we kind of hit it off, being active and discussing the series on one of the message boards; we liked and left feedback on each others' stories, chatted a bit in private. we bonded over personal stuff, a bit, too. and for the curious, this was a platonic thing - i'm a gay guy, she's a straight(?) married woman.      anyway, we wind up being friends on facebook, and i think that may be where the trouble started.      thing is... i know what it's like to *be* clingy. i've had to deal with the fallout from it in the past, and it's something i've really tried to work on, something i get very self-conscious about whenever i make a new friend. in the past, i've had friends who would say nothing about it until they reached a breaking point, and then they'd be pretty harsh about it when the dam finally broke.      the point of this is that... jill was quite clingy herself. it came about pretty quickly after a certain point. like, within less than half a year of our knowing each other.      she knew my working hours, but she'd constantly message me to talk when she knew i'd be sleeping, or getting ready to go to work, or *at* work. or when she knew i was trying to take time to myself to do something else - gaming, writing, whatever. sometimes i'd talk a bit, or tell her i'd talk to her later when i had a chance (like if i needed to get ready for work, or bed, or something). if we went more than a few days without talking too much, regardless of the reason, she'd kind of guilt trip me over it. "i missed talking to you," "it feels like it's been so long since we talked," et cetera... mind that it was generally maybe 3 or 4 days at most between conversations. she'd also get down on herself, and i can't tell if she was being manipulative or what. "i know i'm probably boring/annoying/not much fun to talk to. i'm a wreck." things like that. i don't know how to respond to stuff like that other than just "no you're not" or whatever. i'm not good with that stuff. she knew that.      i did try to be tactful and point out to jill - more than once - that while i enjoyed talking to her, hey, i had to sleep, or work, or get ready for work, and i had other stuff i needed to get done. i didn't want to outright *say* "you know i have a life outside of you, right?", but then again... maybe i should've?      either way, she kinda ramped it up. asking for my address so she could send me stuff i'd mentioned offhand (i mentioned in a facebook post that i was gonna save up to buy a keyboard, she offered to send me one if i'd give her my address - and it was at a point where i wasn't comfortable with the idea). trying to find new excuses to strike up conversation ("i had a dream that something terrible happened to you, so message me when you get this, because i get freaked out over stuff like that") even though we'd spoken only a day or two ago.      eventually, i got tired of jill not getting it, and got so uncomfortable with her and her clinginess persisting despite my stated discomfort with it, that i ghosted her. blocked her on fanfiction.net, blocked her on facebook, on my phone. i was getting really stressed out from dealing with her. and maybe i should've been more sympathetic, because i'd been her before. i'd been that person whose co-dependent nature pushed people away. but even seeing a notification from her stressed me out majorly. she seemed to want me to be her therapist (never mind i have a ton of my own issues to deal with), to be on-call for her when she was lonely (never mind that she has a husband she seems to love deeply and was always praising him), and so on.      apparently, after i ghosted her, jill took it pretty hard for a while.      thing is... this was over a year ago. you'd think she'd have maybe moved on a little since then, yeah? she has other friends, as far as i know, that she really gets along with well, too. she seems more social.      except, last week, another writer we were both friends with (i'll call her "claire") pmed me on fanfiction.net. mostly to say hi, let me know a new game was coming out in the series that we all wrote for, that she was excited and all that. we weren't all that close, but she'd message me periodically to chat. i respond, say "hey, claire, i'm excited too, sorry i've been so quiet lately but i had a lot to deal with recently, hope to get back to writing soon."      she responds, says she hopes so too, and also, "hey, why don't you drop jill a line? she's really missed you this past year."      so, apparently, jill still doesn't get that i'm not comfortable talking to her, and despite my pointing it out multiple times, she doesn't get that i wanted space and boundaries and stopped talking to her because she didn't respect those. so, now i'm anxious again, even though i don't have to interact with her if i don't want to. i just wish she'd move on and stop clinging to me. i have no idea *why* she even clung to me to begin with. it's just irritating.      tl;dr: extremely clingy and codependent friend drove me off because she didn't respect that i needed space, and she's still clinging to me over a year after we stopped talking.

Neutral	i know it's a shitpost, but what i've noticed is that getting pregnant is being treated like it's a random event that just occurs. like a woman was walking down the street and "bam" she's pregnant.      one of the outcomes of having sex is you could get pregnant. i don't see why you should be able to end a life because you accepted but ignored the risks. no other aspect of life or law in america gives you second chances or "do-overs" like that with no repercussions.      personally, i was always super careful when having sex to not get anyone pregnant. yeah, i would have loved to not use a condom here and there or whatever, but the risk was to high imho.      except for rape and incest pregnancies, which are extremely rare, most women who get an abortion were just having sex with no birth control and just hoping for the best. i don't believe that should give you a free pass to kill a fetus.      not to mention, if a man commits a violent crime against a pregnant woman, it is considered even more heinous than if the woman was not pregnant. so obviously the law already gives weight to an unborn baby. a jury will treat someone who shot a woman in the stomach different than someone who shoots a pregnant woman in the stomach. so people do value a fetus, it's just mental gymnastics to allow abortions and think it's perfectly fine.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	white brogressives are the worst with this stuff. they take a few sociology courses and now they think they can tell oppressed people what they're actually experiencing. if you're trying to be an ally, the best thing you can do is support from the sidelines and let the affected groups do the talking. if they're saying something objectively fallacious, that's one thing. but if they're regaling a personal experience about experiencing, or not experiencing, oppression, listen to them, and dont try to correct them. you cant, it's a lived experience. theres nothing to correct.      i'd also like to point out that even if a person of an oppressed group says something fallacious, it doesnt give you carte blanche to say ignorant or potentially hateful stuff to them either. you also cant tell them what they 'should do', because they dont 'have to do' anything because of their status in society. the best way to approach this, i.e. a black person who doesnt believe in racial profiling by police due to never being profiled, is to just provide data that proves them wrong, and then to tell them that an individual experience doesnt represent a collective phenomenon. correcting them isnt your place, nor is diminishing what they say. but providing empirical data to broaden perspective is fine.

Neutral	it's literally impossible to discuss mansplaining on r/twoxchromosomes. if a thread title contains that term, it gets immediately downvoted to the negatives and five or six posts by men saying "why do you have to use such a sexist term?" for that matter, any topic that has to do with men mistreating women is probably going to get downvoted. and if, like most redditors, you always sort by "hot," you'll never see this (the topics never rise up on "hot" because they are downvoted immediately). it's only when you sort topics by new that you'll see these topics posted and immediately downvoted.

Neutral	reddit routinely shows they have zero idea what a libertarian is.      they think we're anti gay, yet the lp was the first party to support gay marriage...in the 1970s.       they think we're pro mega corp but don't understand that most libertarians believe that mega corps only exist through government intervention (see comcast and drug companies).       they think we're anarchists, we're not. most fall within a classically liberal stance, and some like me are minarchists.      they think we want child slave labor, we don't. that's a violation of the nap.       i don't get why it's so hard to just understand that most of our views are based on voluntary exchange, voluntary consent and not violating the nap.       there's certainly some wakadoodles but no more than any other party and i would argue that there are considerably less crazies than the democrat party.

Neutral	**ss:** this is a reminder that israeli mossad was active in and around christchurch new zealand for nearly a decade. even though christchurch, nz was of no obvious relevance to israeli intelligence services, mossad was active in what was at minimum a passport scam and had penetrated intelligence databases:      > security experts suggested agents for mossad may have been on an identity theft "trawling" mission for information, so that the passports of unwitting citizens could be cloned.       > there were fears that other israeli operatives, in the city after the february 22 quake which killed 181 people, could have embedded malicious software to access intelligence information.       >the false passports would then be used as cover during espionage activities in other parts of the world by israeli secret agents.      >fred tulett, editor of the southland times, said **an "extraordinary" reaction by the israeli government in the hours after the earthquake had heightened the suspicions of new zealand's security intelligence service.**        > shemi tzur, israel's ambassador to australia and new zealand, travelled from his base in australia to christchurch, where he visited the temporary morgue set up to cope with earthquake victims.   meanwhile, **israel's defence chief also flew to the earthquake-ravaged city.**         >in a further move, **a search and rescue team arrived in christchurch from israel, but the squad's offer of help was rejected by new zealand authorities** because it did not have the necessary united nations accreditation.      >**despite that rejection, members of the israeli team were confronted by armed new zealand officers after being discovered in the badly damaged sealed off "red zone" of the city centre,** the southland times said.      >the israeli government later sent a forensic team to help authorities identify the dead.      >the paper said **new zealand officials became alarmed when intelligence information was collated and it was realised that the israeli forensic team had been given access to the police national database to help with identification work.**
Neutral	ok marvel k chode

Neutral	i think this is why sites like 4chan thrive because they can't really be censored like all the mainstream ones. then the media can basically label any user that uses those sites or any information from those sites as 'conspiracy theories' so the dumb people who don't ever actually research anything think any news from these sites are fake.          when in reality their msm sources are fake and 4chan has the topics that msm wouldn't ever cover.          not saying everything on 4chan and related sites is reliable and that there isn't fake news on there but outside the main media sites these are the only places to get the full story.          the way it seems to work is the msm labels any other sources as fake so they can push fake news and the people that only use msm don't know any better and believe any fake news they hear from msm and disregard anything else.          i've noticed this mainly with trump and non trump supporters since 2016. for example, cnn is basically to the point where they don't even try to hide the fake news anymore. they put out tons of fake shit daily and it will get called out on the non-popular news blogs but any anti-trump supporter will always believe cnn and nothing else. then in their mind they never realize that what they support does all the same shit as trump but they just never talk about it so they never know they are supporting corrupt people.          from what i've seen trump supporters will actually call out fake pro-trump news all the time. they will call you out in [USER] for it. all the anti-trump supporters have been brainwashed that [USER] is all white supremacists at this point thanks to the 'alt-right' hoax that msm pushes. most of them are convinced all trump supporters are white supremacists at this point, it blows my mind. when in reality they are the racist, facist and violent ones most of the time. it doesn't matter if trump cured cancer, they would find some type of excuse to continue hating him.

Neutral	and i can't believe that what set me off today was not being able to find part of a fucking ikea cabinet.      i'm not happy, i can't remember the last time i was, and i'm not sure i even know what i need to be happy with my life. i don't know what to do. i've been on antidepressants, and i still feel this way. sometimes i have good days or good weeks, but i usually end up completely melting down and losing it again over something. i don't know how to make it better or if i even can.      i can't afford to move out. i can't afford to rent where i live, i certainly can't afford to buy a house or a flat, and i don't see a way out. every time i'm reminded of the lifestyle my parents had at the same age as me, it upsets me because i know i'll never have that, it's going to pass me by. i don't even know why i want to emulate them in that way because they're divorced now. i'm scared that down the line i'm going to feel like i've missed a whole chapter of my own life.      my girlfriend broke up with me a year ago. she did the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me, i don't forgive her and i never will. i find it hard to meet people and i thought she was going to be it for me. i still miss her and i think i'm probably going to carry this for the rest of my life. she didn't just take away the relationship, she took away all the hopes and dreams i had for being a proper functioning adult and being happy. what's really bothering me about it right now is that i ruined things - before they even started - with another girl who liked me and who i liked too, to be with her. this absolutely is my fault and even if it probably wouldn't have worked out with her i spend far too much time thinking about if i blew my chance at being happy with someone.      i hate my job. if you told me tomorrow that it was gone and i could never go back, i wouldn't care. wouldn't give one single solitary fuck. i hate the building, i hate the place it's in, i hate the noise, i hate the customers, i hate all of it. i could just find a new job and leave, but i feel so completely ground down and i don't think i would find anything better so i can't motivate myself to. i could go back to university and learn to do something else but not without getting myself into a lot of debt i'll never be able to pay off.      i've never wanted to have a real job, because i can't handle the real world. as a kid i dreamed of being an athlete, although it became clear pretty early on that i was never going to be. i love sports but i'm just not good enough to even play at a recreational level, and that kills me and i don't enjoy them as much as i would like because of that. then i started to pursue music, and i was ok at that, but i just can't do it. i can't meet other people who share the same musical aspirations as me, i can't write a song because nothing comes out when i try to, i just can't get it right.      i can't stop obsessing over things that i can't change. i can't stop obsessing over perfection and trying to obtain it. i can't stop obsessing over how all kinds of small details in my life are wrong. i can't feel part of anything. i can't even build a set of fucking shelves. i can't have all the time back that i've wasted. i can't cope.      and i feel like an entitled little prick for being bothered by these things as much as i am.

Neutral	how about we restrict the flow of capital, not labor. instead of the current state where capital is free to do as it wishes but international workers are ticketed serfs.      immigration has literally nothing at all to do with current wage levels. capitalism is amply capable of extracting virtually all surplus value from the workers at all levels of supply. but capital doesn't even really give a shit about immigration, look at how quickly the billionaires lined up behind trump. what is important to them is their ability to shift capital to tax havens, not increasing the net labor in the united states. they are just glad you are distracted.      but capital isn't interested in building factories in poor countries. it is only interested in stripping them of their resources to prop up the imperial core. net flows of capital from the global south to the global north are over six trillion a year. yes that includes the foreign aid, the small pittance that you begrudgingly hand out and expect oh so much gratitude for. it doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of all that the neocolonial empire takes from the third world to prop up its empire. without the imf, the world bank, and the military industrial complex, america would be nothing but a bunch of gas stops.

Neutral	peele is pretty good. get out was a good movie but *way* overhyped. us was suspenseful, but the plot made no sense and the twist was obvious.      also, fun fact, the skill of a writer or director has nothing to do with race.      also also, how does "look at the 'great' american authors," prove that white people make formulaic shit? there are more white people in the world than the ones in america and not all americans are white. so that's comparing two different groups. not to mention many american authors are/were great authors and the implication that they weren't is bullshit.      also also also, white people don't make formulaic crap, corporations do. look at black panther, for example. that's a generic royal family story where an evil relative challenges the honorable rightful heir to the throne *and* a generic superhero origin that ends with the protagonist fighting an evil version of himself.

Neutral	> in which case isn't that an indication that the democrats have failed to do right by them?      that's a matter of perspective.      the democrats are doing exactly what they want to do to the blacks.      give them money for clothes for school.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	to be fair, christianity is pretty sexist. it's actually racist too, what with yahweh having a chosen people, but the dominionism helps offset that. oh, and i can point to several well known christian pastors that believe that marital rape isn't a thing and that it's a wife's duty to satisfy her husband whenever he wishes. and expecting priests to be celibate does seem to cause issues with pedophilia.       all that being said, if christianity never existed, it wouldn't make any of those things go away. they would just have to find some other excuse to justify their actions.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	cant be racist if youre black
Neutral	eww, ess posters.
Neutral	> how about we just ban motorcycles? for the average us citizen, there's little economic or functional need for them and the risk of death in a motorcycle accident even with a helmet is still much higher than just driving a nice, safe cage. or we could just stop looking to the state to be mommy and daddy for everyone.      > ban living. it leads to death.       > communism does that pretty effectively      oof. this exchange is pretty funny to me, as someone living in the communist utopia that is vietnam (actually more of a state capitalist like china) where motorcycle is the most common mean of transportation and helmets are legally required. sure wish i could go around and ask how mad the people who avoided head injuries thanks to helmet are at *''communists''* taking away their freedom (around 500,000 of them since 2007, according to statistics)

PersonDirectedAbuse	i think she tries to be like trump, because she thinks it'll be a winning strategy. the biggest difference is that while trump's rhetoric intends to be unifying from a nationalist standpoint, aoc and her wing of the democratic party seek division on the basis of race, gender, and class.      how often does trump mention "white people" as often as democrats and their supporters reference "brown people"? same goes for men, the rich, or whatever other bogeyman is causing today's national crisis.
Neutral	there are plenty of those, they just don't grow very quickly.
Neutral	>same thing goes for power dynamics and grooming. these are problems independent of incest, and ones aren't inherent if you're talking about similarly aged cousins or siblings.      i don't see your point. both implications of this view sound correct to me. yes, it means incest is not wrong in and of itself, but only as a side-effect of being a power imbalance, and it means relatives who grew up sufficiently apart that they don't have a family power dynamic is morally fine. you seem to treat those like they count against this reasoning but i don't see why.

Neutral	so then life is good? great, we're on the same page. i'm honestly glad you feel that way.      and does knowing that death being the end of life (something good) is completely unavoidable, completely unchangeable, change anything for you?      it can't be escaped, so why spend all of the time you do have free from death thinking about it, fearing it? you don't change anything. you only waste the time you do have on the most meaningless topic.      does knowing the eggs in your fridge will inevitably go bad stop you from baking a cake with them while they're still fresh? no, because cake is delicious and depriving yourself of cake because you know the ingredients have a time limit is nonsensical. similarly, does knowing the eggs will inevitably go bad stop you from putting them in the fridge so you can extend the time in which you can use them? no.      likewise, knowing there is a time limit to your life shouldn't stop you from living it. nor does it make it nonsensical to try to extend it, it's just that at some point you might as well bake the cake, because the end is inevitable.

Neutral	you're a public figure
Neutral	i get what you are saying, but "there exists a problem" is just as factual as "there exists 25,009 of a thing". it's verifiable. it's even verifiable if you include the word serious. people are concerned about it nationwide, no one has a solution, the costs are high, it's in the national discourse. these are all objective things.       now i understand that the stance one can take on the problem of illegal immigration in the us is varied and subjective, but the existence and degree of the problem is pretty objective.       the issue i have with this is because pew is authoritative and the research by pew is often used in partisan arguments. to me it felt like they were trying to subtly reinforce or even implant the bias that illegal immigration is not a problem or worse that it's a partisan problem.       and the thing is most of the people i interact with on a daily basis are very liberal and would use pew as a source in a given partisan argument.

Neutral	'bad faith' is even worse than that. they're not questioning whether you really believe what you're saying, they're questioning whether you'll easily change your mind if they bother to summon the energy to have a conversation with you. if they think you won't, they justify it as 'bad faith' because they can't easily convince you.       that's really the bones of it, it's that vapid and self-serving. they think it's not worth it arguing with people who argue in 'bad faith' because they actually believe what they're saying. the only want to argue against people they will easily convince. as someone who argues a fair amount on reddit for a reason that becomes increasingly less sensible every day, i'm jealous of their ability to dismiss people entirely because they don't like them and smugly believe it makes them morally superior.

Neutral	it still shocks me to see the man i saw as one of the funniest comedians around becoming one of the best original horror directors in ages.
Neutral	that and, if reddit's community didn't use the downvote button as a disagree button, i wouldn't be writing this post.      i do not like the current fad of releasing remakes and remasters of everything, especially in nintendo consoles. additionally, i am not a fan of nintendo's practices of charging double the price for ports than you see on other consoles (skyrim costs twice as much on the switch than on the ps4/xbox, the new final fantasy ports are apparently all at least 40€).      i am certainly not the only person who thinks this, because it is not the first time i see threads and comments being showered with replies that can be summed up to 'shut up and accept it' and flurries of downvotes.      some of us do not need to relive our childhood, teenagehood or whatever with constant remakes or remasters. some of us would like new original content or sequels. but since most people keep buying these, companies have realized they can have more profit with half the work by remaking, remastering and re-releasing these games with special edition instead of focusing on other, different projects. this is what gives us stuff like pokémon let's go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since dlc/complete versions come out the year later.      i am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset i am disagreeing with. there are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (pokémon fire red/leaf green, the 3ds zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much. and that is what some of us want to voice their disapproval over, but can't because the downvote brigade rains down on dissent. i had to unsubcribe from r/nintendoswitch because of this, the hivemind is just plain insufferable.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	once the group positions the targeted citisen into category that allows surveillance, data can be used in many ways,             both aginst the target and in favor of desired other parties, usually oponents.             its business secrets and personal details roam through such network practically unsuperwised and are by the word of the mouth often common knowledge.             this means its competition can get the customers that were initially won by target or data about target's providers etc.             whole businesses can be and as it looks, are sidelined nand ruined in such way.      or hijacked by favoured friends.             also, this channel seems to be always useful for information on target's contacts with occasional oportunities to spawn a new surveiled "terrrorist"      on so widen the surveillance pool.             this effectively means that slovenia is one of "dual bookkeeping" countries. one set of books ( eu directives crap, constitution, laws and bylaws,      human rights, gdpr, yaddayadda) are for presentation purposes, talk points etc. underlying "eye of the mordor" book tell the real story, which boil down to:             - there is no privacy      - citisen's data belongs to the state, when and where it needs it      - there is no data protection. if citisen's personal secrets are known to ever postman on the other part of the country, it's because this was needed      - rules from "showroom presentation books" are valid only if not stated othewise in case-by-case basis      - there is no free market, really. state can veto any or all citisen's business connections, transactions and/or relations             on such "market" favoured group of citisens have surveilance and repressive machinery favoring them, anyone else has to work against the flow.             other useful application is a feedback loop. acquired data can be used for attack and then reacquired for corrections.      has enough poison been used ? how susceptible is a target to it ? has it mentioned specific spot ?      if so, this can be used as an additional time for its destination scene setup etc.             lateral data movement through such criminal mesh is sometimes used to cover its "operating costs", so it can be used for thefts, robberies,      life insurrance claims etc. some things can e.g. literraly be funded off the life insurance claim of murdered target.             so, this data channel seem to be used to generate "revenue" through various means for group growth until banks take over and real $$$ starts flowing in.      acquired do  benefit them, but are probably seen just as an additional beneficial effect from killed and sidelined unwanted elements - iow "tip for the job well done".             it is unclear how do they plan to stop that phase- banking interests would probably decide to continue to purge that pyramid off newly  unneded, increasingly higer layers.      which means, as machines and ai progress, it will be increasingly harder for pyramid members to stay alive...             iow, once group kills womever are told that needs to be killed, layers beneathe them will become dangerously thin in very short order. it seems clear that banking interests intend to stay outside of that structure ( this is probably why the jews in eu will get separate areas/enclaves etc).             for everyone else in such system, there seem to be no way to stay outside such eternal be useful-or-die pyramid.             when the need for killing service falls  low, those services won't be so valuable, so most of the killers will be pruned off ( in fact, most of the non-technical/scientific staff). then, as machine learning takes over, circle of those needed will shrink around the narrowest reaches of human mind that are hardest to automate.       that is, until those become superfluous, too...

IdentityDirectedAbuse	when you purchase a company, you also purchase all of its contracts. those would be sales contracts and contracts to employees and debtors. so yes, sears douche has a legal obligation to pay the severances since that's something he purchased as a responsibility. if he had no intention of pay the severances then they needed to be paid by the seller prior to sale or escrow the funds from sale to have paid at the proper time. if the bankruptcy court rules him not liable to pay on these contracts, all it proves is the country is morally bankrupt and shitbag rich people don't have rules

Neutral	i really wanted to not comment on this, but its incredibly frustrating when people post this comment because its so tone deaf.       first, the pride event started as a riot. it wasn't a happy parade with rainbows and dance music. it was a bunch or angry gays finally saying "we've had enough" and standing up to police brutality and raids on gay spaces.       since then, the movement has endured the aids crisis, and we only had each other when the government did nothing.       we created new spaces to welcome in the people who never fit into society.       and for the decades, lgbtq+ youth have been the targets of hate crimes. they face hate speech and the fear of death in some places. gay-youth have some of the highest rates of suicide in north america.       we have had to rally and throw our sexuality "in your face" just to fucking marry the person we love.       gay people have been denied jobs, or fired because of their sexuality.       for many people, pride isn't "just" about celebrating being gay, its about celebrating that despite being gay, we have survived the harassment, the violence, the depression and anxiety. its about remembering those who did the hardest of the work to get us to where we are today. so yes, we absolutely should be proud of being gay and all the baggage that has come with it. straight people aren't attacked for being straight. you have never been denied a job for being straight. you have had the privilege of being in the majority. to marry who you love.       now, that being said there is a lot about pride that even i have issues with. but pride reminds us of where we were and how far we've come.        and please, for the love of god, don't come at me with "but no one cares about you being gay in 2019" because that's bullshit. the orlando shooting happened 3 years ago. a gay man in my town was stabbed - for being gay - just last summer. there are still countries where homosexuality is illegal.       ....and thats the end of my rant.
Neutral	i am going to come across as a lewronggeneration type but i really, really miss how society didn't used to be so hypersexual.   like it seems like porn is just everywhere instead of just in adult stores and theaters and in my city there are all these billboards advertising strip clubs.  there are literally 4 in my small city!  also i am tired of almost every show being way over sexualized....it is boring not exciting.

Neutral	poor flareon was done dirty by the mechanics of the first few generations. when a pokémon uses a move of its type it gets a lot stronger, so any fire move flareon used would be more powerful. flareon also has a lot of physical attack, so it wants to use fire moves that hit physically.       the only issue is that before gen 4, moves were classified as "physical" or "special" not inherently, but by their type. so every single fire move (including fire *punch*) was a special move, which flareon could not use effectively. throw on top of this a super shallow move pool of lackluster coverage and you could see why jolteon or vaporeon saw a lot more usage.       they eventually additionally gave flareon stronger moves on top of the physical and special split

Neutral	i really think israel and us were the only ones both capable and willing to do 9/11. the british used to sell weapons to the saudis and they had no idea how to use them until very recently, so they must have stepped up their game rapidly. israel has tried to also blame things on egyptians before, lavon affair. and one of the leaders tied to the 9/11 attack was an egyptian who had "masterminded" the plan of shooting at a bus. none of these guys seems like geniuses. bin laden had been responsible for large scale attacks in the past and he was tied to 9/11 instantly, but bin laden never seem to really try to milk the attack afterwards. the only thing we ever saw of him was a few grainy videos, then they shot him in the face and dumped him in the ocean, apparently.      they should continue to investigate 9/11, it also seems unreal that they didn't seem very interested in painstakingly investigating the evidence. answers were quickly given, end of story, no red flags at all..      edit: saudi's have always been bad with weapons the west has sold them, even lately here. can't operate weaponry, can pull off 9/11. it just doesn't make sense.

Neutral	> applied health is absolutely science      if applied health is science, then applied physics and applied chemistry would be science, but instead we label those as engineering.      when medicine is to be included, they generally use the term stemm. very few nurses are published, which is a key component of science, testing theories and sharing those results. incidentally, this applies to a whole lot of medical doctors, too.      in a sense this is also why your car mechanic is not part of stem, even though the people designing the components of the car would be engineering.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	everyone's so worried about *school shooters that they caused**to care that more people die from suicide by gun than anything else in america.      real mental health awareness could save a lot of lives in this country. imagine if everyone got the help they needed?  people could have meaningful relationships. people could enjoy things again. people would stop killing themselves and each other in droves.      edit: * *there's a difference between psycho spree shooters and a shooters who wants revenge for being tormented.      it's a touchy subject but if you don't make the distinction you can't put the blame where it really belongs.  psychos are psycho. they're going to kill someone or something.* it's all a matter of when.* and it's rare when they're caught before they do something because they come off as normal teenage outcasts.      as for the bullied shooters.   *did anyone ever think they went too far with their bullying before their classmate pulled a gun?*   did the school staff notice ? or did they let him / her fall through the cracks into a void of misery and depression? did anyone even bother to make the effort to reach out to them ?      i'm just tired of this hindsight is 20/20 bullshit. bullied shooters can be prevented if we all stopped being assholes to each other.

Neutral	a friend of mine who lives in france had a teacher who started a fundraiser for the notre dame fire. he raised a couple hundred  euro, as some had already donated to a separate fundraiser, or simply didn't want to. but the reason why he did it still warms my heart.      when asked why he simply said "my daughters favourite film is the hunchback of notre dame, i promised her i'd take her to it. im not going to let her see some rubble, i want her to see the place she saw in the film so i'll do whatever i can to help"      and still i think some girl is so lucky to have him as  her dad

Neutral	thank you for this. very well put and i agree, at least for the harmless theories.
Neutral	i think the op has the theory that pikachu is popular because it's always portrayed as being a faithful always-loyal companion. the theory is that since "everyone is sad and lonely", they've been brainwashed into loving pikachu because pikachu is portrayed as being an eternal friend.      further, they're arguing that this is similar to the way conspiracy-style communities recruit people. as that flat-earther documentary on netflix showed, a major recruiting point for 'crazy' groups is the companionship of a community. lonely people often gravitate towards these kinds of groups because they're more willing to accept outsiders, and are more tolerant of deviant behaviour.      that in itself is accurate, but using it to describe why people like pikachu is pretty crazy. people like pikachu because it's a cute critter, which is brave, fun to watch, and (usually) reminds us of our childhoods.

Neutral	if a man approaches me on the street, and i've got _visible_ headphones in, and i don't react at all, he assumes i can't hear him. (i'm gonna use male pronouns here, as i have still not been creeped on by a woman / non-binary person on the street, ever)      no harm, no foul, so he'll walk on.       if i don't have headphones, he'll start talking, try to make eye contact, and grab my arm. last time it was some guy who "really wanted a chat" in the middle of the pavement. turned out he'd been high for the last 72 hours, and just wanted to go back to mine to fuck, and the fact i had a partner wasn't enough to deter him.       i had tried the whole wasn't paying attention thing, but he'd started walking beside me talking by then, so it didn't really help.      so yeah, it's helpful. if you can't hear the bullshit, you don't have to focus on not reacting, and creeps sometimes assume the same!

Neutral	ok, maybe i'm wrong about that, but you're ignoring all of my other arguments.       there's no way the "elite" would employ a technology like this they knew for sure was harmful because they themselves would be subject to its effects.       also there are plenty of crazy people that claim the current wifi is harmful to humans and we **know** that to be true. my own mother in law claims it makes her sick but considering she's a hypochondriac organic fracking/monsanto spends-1k-a-month-on-ridiculous-supplements-that-do-nothing health nut, her opinion is  pretty invalid.       all of the people claiming to be sick from this are most likely the same kind of crazy as her.

Neutral	not true, crowder is more popular and almost any show on fox news then if you take radio host into account ben shapiro isn't even close to the top. he is well known because he debates dumb leftest college students and puts it on youtube so people know of him from that. very few actually care what he has to say politically though. he averages like 200,000k viewers on his youtube channel where he discusses his actual political views. a number of those viewers also clearly l don't like him as often you can see top comments calling him a "zionist shill". sean hannity has like a million viewers a night, which is more then most shapiro videos will ever get. my local conservative talk radio station averages numbers that are close to shapiro at peak times ffs.         tucker carlson is the most popular show in his time slot and averages an ungodly amount of people. the most popular figure in the right is tucker right now without a doubt, crowder is pretty close as well as his videos on youtube average almost 1 million plus views. which is kind of interesting as both have pretty different views with tucker being more a nationalist and crowder more of a traditional conservative. little ben though is now where near this much less "one of the most popular online presences in the world".

Neutral	increasing the minimum wage does nothing but hurt lower-income households. mcdonalds and other fast food places are just going to implement robots and kiosks instead of paying some teenager 15 or 20 dollars an hoyr to flip a fucking burger.  you need to educate yourself on *basic* economics because you sound like you are in early high school based on your logic.       and norway has been successful because of capitalism lol. the nordic model shows that it was even more successful pre-1975 before they started implementing more socialistic policies. read some thomas sowell, that would be a good start.

Neutral	no one said "questioning the accuracy and reliability of animal testing based on the findings of over 20 scientific papers" makes you a "preachy vegan." what shows that you have an "ax" to grind is exactly what i pointed out: misconstruing the respondent's response to mean what you want it to mean instead of what it actually said and using emotionally charged rhetoric like "vivesectionist" to describe the respondent when you have no idea whether or not their work involves cutting animals.        i think that was very plainly stated in my last post and you're being purposely obtuse so that you can redirect the conversation the way you would like it to go.  given your previous escapades into rhetorical chicanery it's not surprising, but you shouldn't expect anyone to take you seriously when you play dumb and pretend you really don't understand the responses you get.     
Neutral	it's a question as old as time.

Neutral	you're talking about a police department that had to disband their version of swat because they were committing burglaries in their off hours. a department where the cops feel so entitled that an off duty cop beat the shit out of a female bartender for cutting him off and no one dared intervene. a department where 10 years of convictions are being overturned for one district because they committed torture. this isn't blm, police suck bullshit. this is a department that has some serious cultural issues that need to be addressed. i would say cpd is where nypd was in the serpico days.

Neutral	i feel like the "thank you" note/email is a generational thing that is being phased out. when i was looking up baby shower stuff, a few sites insisted on the parents sending thank you notes to everyone after the event- but we'd already thanked them at the event and nobody seems to think it was rude for us to forego the formality of asking for an address and sending a bit of cardboard to them. it only feels necessary to send a text/email if the giver isn't there when you receive their gift.       i mean i could be wrong and it turns out i just wasn't raised right but that has been my observation

Neutral	the example you give is exactly the kind of thing that plenty of folks in aita would insist that "yes, you are the asshole, he was just being friendly/is a touchy person/whatever excuse."      however, if he posted complaining that you told him not to touch you and he insulted you as a result, they'd have his back and assure him that his words were justified.

Neutral	first off, op, i am sorry you had to go through that..i cant begin to imagine.      ive noticed a strong trend in a lot of comedic movies, especially when surrounding sex. multiple movies will have a scene where the man is put into a scenario where he doesnt want sex or to be touched, but the woman will persist to the point where it is 100% rape, but the way the scene is set, it makes you believe its comedic. but switch the roles where a woman is not wanting the sexual advances and then the audience gasps and feel disturbed. and its completely the fault of the writers. continuing a trend where its comedic when a man doesnt want it.      thats not to say that there isnt comedic value in a "get me the fuck outta here, this isnt what i signed up for" type of scene. but the manner in which the scenes provoke sex, and then masked with comedy, starts a problem.      im just happy to see that others have noticed this kind of thing in movies.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	but are they socially awkward because they have been raised within that group? or because that group actively recruits them when they are older?      most of the christian churches fill from within.. go forth, multiply, if your kids aren't dunked in jesus juice early they are going to hell, etc.       other groups (scientology,) prey pretty heavily on adults, who already have money to funnel to their upline to buy access to the bridge. there's some recruiting through the "youth outreach" she'll companies, but most of it, as well, is designed to grab parents who will pay dearly for shitty "tech" to save their kids.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	no. no one yet has really given me a hard time. one or two people were surprised, one person did comment such as 'if i had known you were interested in men i may have pursued you', but other than that most people are just like 'neat, glad you're happy'.        to be honest the worst issues i've had come from the more... vocal, steadfast members of the community in general - that's where you'll find 'militant' gays as i like to term them - ones who think bisexuals and transgender people are cheating and aren't included. which is folly; the one thing we all have in common is discrimination based on a circumstance of birth, it's so sad to see some people in the community act like 'people have to accept me but you cannot be any lower than this or you're scum'.         generally, i avoid the hardcore lgbt+ scene itself and just... have friends who happen to maybe be gay, or bi, or whatever, because they're human and generally humans tick some kinda box for who they smoosh with.

Neutral	that's especially disappointing. i find it really annoying when people treat basic quality of life decisions for games as "too easy." it's the difference between playing legend of zelda: wind waker with 3 hearts versus playing it with no sail. once provides a challenge in limited resources and forces you to fundamentally rethink how you approach the game. the other is just a pain in the ass that drags it out.      and let's not even get started with  l i n e a r i t y.      there are much better ways to analyze a game better than just calling quality of life features bad and watering down difficulty. legend of zelda: majora's mask 3d is a good example as the remake makes a number of changes on the surface trying to address hiccups the n64 version, but in doing so created new larger problems. there's a lot to unpack in that about how you can address one change but make something else considerably more annoying or eliminate the premise of the challenge set in the first place. the original majora's mask was and still is generally considered one of if not the hardest zelda games in the series, and it'd be reductive to just say "the new one is easier, it's worse" even if the remake is easier overall.

Neutral	learning moment: you wanna know the sexual subtext of don quixote?      aldonza, the peasant girl don quixote calls dulcinea, is described as a mannish, rough-hewn woman (aldonza was considered a rustic name, like how we in english view names like "bertha" or "helga"). the subtext behind don quixote's fascination with her is suggestive of how some upper-class types viewed lowborn women as more promiscuous or sexual, because they weren't as delicate or bound by the rules of decorum as upper-class women.      as for other women, don quixote always operates on the assumption they're immediately smitten with him, and uses his devotion to chivalry and dulcinea as an excuse to turn down their advances... despite none of them ever showing signs of interest. there's one chapter where a prostitute enters his room by mistake, he embraces her and tells her this, but it's dark and she doesn't understand his archaic language, so she attacks him in self-defense and a fracas ensues.      i hate when people read sexual subtext into *everything*, but these readings have legs imo.

Neutral	i don't think you fully understand the situation and capabilities of this technology. 5g routers have not been around for a decade, you are confusing 5ghz wi-fi with 5g technology. there is a ton of shit to learn. people are already getting sick from current technologies, 5g will be increasing the frequency to 10-30 ghz, not sure the exact frequencies entirely because i can't seem to find a straight fucking answer ([URL]) . not only that, the power level is also increasing.       i feel like a healthy society, would test all of this before they deployed it on millions and billions of people. try to find a study that says any of this is harmless or healthy. you won't. you'll find one study done on fake tissue, only looking at thermal induction.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i'm finding myself feeling pretty sceptical as to how much of the current online reaction is organic, on either "side". i'm actually a little surprised at just how strongly my gut's crying "suspicious!".      i'm not blaming all division in the democratic base on russian bots, mind you: there's no doubt, for example, trump supporters trying to ratfuck - possibly on their own "grassroots" initiative, possibly as a more-organised thing set up by some big-money republican backer(s).      and i wouldn't put it past people (be they pro- or anti-sanders) who are still *super-mad* about the 2016 primary to have schemed up their own astroturf, ready to let loose the moment he declared - thinking that if only they bot hard enough it'd strengthen the impression of a consensus in their favoured direction, never mind that's gonna backfire horribly if everyone's doing it.      not to mention, although i don't believe i ever saw conclusive proof of it actually happening back in 2016, i can't entirely discount the possibility of candidate-affiliated shills - think the allegations thrown around about shareblue / correct the record, or conversely revolution messaging.      all that said... also, russian bots.

IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	a response from microsoft to imjustabagofhammers      > let's talk about imjustabagofhammers's complaints. let's talk about them in a very specific and personal way. here's the story: imjustabagofhammers sees itself as a postmodern equivalent of marx's proletariat, revolutionizing the world by wresting it from its oppressors (viz., those who increase awareness and understanding of our similarities and differences). for some odd reason, imjustabagofhammers believes that laws are meant to be broken. its unasinous aides-de-camp, who believe likewise, also fail to see that the feudalism "debate" is not a debate. it is a harangue, a politically motivated, brilliantly publicized, irrational attack on progressive ideas.      > imjustabagofhammers wonders why everyone hates it. apparently, it never stopped to think that maybe it's because it's easy enough to hate it any day of the week on general principles. but now i'll tell you about some very specific things that it is up to, things that ought to make a real imjustabagofhammers-hater out of you. first off, i'm not asking whether its verbalisms are valid or whether they have any application to current topics of theoretical and political importance. i'm asking only the following specific question: is it possible for those who defend morally questionable imperialism to make their defense look more raffish than it currently is? this isn't such an easy question to answer, but let me take a stab at it: imjustabagofhammers's soliloquies have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together—life! i would inarguably not have thought it possible that imjustabagofhammers gained ascendancy through monstrous abuse of its foot soldiers, but it's true. how did imjustabagofhammers get so yellow-bellied? i have my theories, but they're only speculation. at any rate, an understanding of the damage that may be caused by its swinish rejoinders isn't something i expect everyone to develop the first time they hear about it. that's why i write over and over again and from so many different angles about how imjustabagofhammers has stated that its ruses epitomize wholesome family entertainment. i find such declaratory statements quite telling. they tell me that i'm no psychiatrist. still, from the little i know about psychiatry i can undeniably say that imjustabagofhammers seems to exhibit many of the symptoms of asperger's syndrome. i don't say that to judge but merely to put imjustabagofhammers's rebarbative philosophies into perspective.      > the sad truth is that our nation is infected with the poisons of nepotism, stoicism, and xenophobia. and the sadder truth is that those poisons have been fed, watered, fertilized, and fostered by imjustabagofhammers and its claque. on that note, let me say that i defy the insolent, petty ogres who ridicule the accomplishments of generations of great men and women, and i defy the powers of darkness that they represent. imjustabagofhammers exhibits signs of arrested development, don't you think? what i'm trying to say is that imjustabagofhammers's rummy, brown-nosing ideologies are meticulously designed to keep the population unaware, uneducated, dumbed down, and focused on stupefying activities like video games. the intention is to prevent people from noticing that imjustabagofhammers has been funding, assembling, and training alabandical whiners to shove us towards an absolute state of vassalage. some people have said that imjustabagofhammers's record of truth-telling is, shall we say, less than a hundred percent. maybe. but i'm more inclined to believe that i unequivocally dislike imjustabagofhammers. likes or dislikes, however, are irrelevant to observed facts, such as that imjustabagofhammers has the nerve to call those of us who follow through on the critical work that has already begun "conspiracy theorists". no, we're "conspiracy revealers" because we reveal that imjustabagofhammers has quite a clever technique for concealing its intent to make us the helpless puppets of our demographic labels. specifically, its technique is to delve into philological discussions about comparative abstractive norms whenever the conversation veers too close towards revealing that its vassals have repeatedly been caught making people suspicious of those who speak the truth. i had expected better from imjustabagofhammers and its vaunted loony-bin crew, but then again, it keeps trying to expose and neutralize its detractors rather than sit at the same table and negotiate. and if we don't remain eternally vigilant, it will honestly succeed. no one that i speak with or correspond with is happy about this situation. of course, i don't speak or correspond with repulsive criminal masterminds, imjustabagofhammers's confederates, or anyone else who fails to realize that knowledge is the key that unlocks the shackles of bondage. that's why it's important for you to know that imjustabagofhammers must be surrounded by some sort of reality-distortion field. why else would its encomiasts claim that it is forward-looking, open-minded, and creative? if it weren't for all that reality distortion they'd instead be observing that imjustabagofhammers's tricks have merged with frotteurism in several interesting ways. both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. both condone universal oppression. and both hijack our educational system and turn it into a self-cloning propaganda machine.      > i recently heard some encouraging news. it appears that imjustabagofhammers's ongoing campaign to create a new cottage industry around its vindictive form of desperadoism has been meeting some opposition. apparently, not everyone wants imjustabagofhammers to undermine the intellectual purpose of higher education. rather, an increasing number of people have come to realize that it seems to have recently added the word "hyperphosphorescence" to its otherwise simplistic vocabulary. i suppose imjustabagofhammers intends to use big words like that to obscure the fact that the very genesis of its moonstruck biases is in bonapartism. and it seems to me to be a neat bit of historic justice that imjustabagofhammers will eventually itself be destroyed by bonapartism.      > although unbiased journalism died long ago, i'm pleased to find at least some minimal reporting of how i, unlike imjustabagofhammers, refuse to beat plowshares into swords. that represents yet more evidence—as if we needed more—that i shall not argue that imjustabagofhammers's newsgroup postings are an authentic map of its plan to expose and punish individuals who do not conform to its philosophies or beliefs. read them and see for yourself. out of the vast number of devastating evils for which hypocritical gomerals are directly or indirectly responsible, i shall pick out only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence of imjustabagofhammers's politically incorrect, ultra-putrid canards: paternalism. i am indeed annoyed with imjustabagofhammers's insistence that views not informed by radical critique implicitly promote hegemonic values. sorry, imjustabagofhammers, but that's not a fact. that's intellectual dishonesty bordering on lunacy. if imjustabagofhammers wanted to speak the truth, it should have said that a recent united nations report on human-rights abuses found that it acts with animus against those who expurgate sectarianism in all its forms from our humble community. the devastating findings of this report should not be ignored. in particular, i want to highlight the report's observation that imjustabagofhammers finds it convenient to blame all of society's woes on deplorable undesirables. doing so fits with the rest of its populist sloganeering and takes less intellectual effort than investigating the structural factors and material practices that may in fact be the true reason that just as night follows day, imjustabagofhammers will mold your mind and have you see the world not as it is but as it wants you to see it before you know it. there are arguments that have made respectable organizations out of nudniks like imjustabagofhammers. so i give you this letter. i hope it helps.

Neutral	i think that whatever you seriously prepare for and consider to be necessary in order to deal with it in the future, is directly inviting the universe to send it your way so you can to find out the real truth about whether it will or it won't since you clearly weren't smart enough to figure that out beforehand and focus all your efforts and resources on creating a far more pleasant and desirable one, instead.      it's one thing to fake and pretend something in a completely contrived and fictitious situation long, long, ago, in a galaxy far, far, away to simply create an entertaining movie and quite another to expect that some of the imaginary contrivances used to do that can be physically created in this reality to provide the same kind of advantages as it did for the equally imaginary hero in that movie.      to put it bluntly they've completely lost touch with reality and it's going to be a spectacular mess when it finally bites them in the ass for doing that.

Neutral	suicide prevention is about getting those disillusioned with our world back to work, able to pay on their debts, and gaslit about what caused them to want to die in the first place. there is a direct link between austerity and suicide rates. when a government is big on austerity, they also are big on suicide prevention. teresa may comes to mind.      imagine suicide nets on iphone factories in china. but more of a social engineering approach on a large scale

Neutral	you've disrupted my thoughts for a while. each time it happens, my mind melts. its dominated by thoughts of you. it's like an attack, one i can't fight. i can't sleep or otherwise function. i can't deal with it 90% of the time. i just have to let it pass and hope it doesn't come back when i'm at my most vulnerable.      and i resent you for it.      you ruined about 90% of my music playlist. i can only listen to songs with neutral themes and no mention of love or romantic relationships. i have no clue how i failed to notice that romance was the main theme for a while in music history. but there it is and you plague it along with my thoughts.      and i resent you for it.      sometimes i wonder why we're even friends at this point in time.      maybe its because i still think i have a chance. but you yourself said you didn't want it because of distance and other drama at that time in your life. i let it go. you're your own person. that's fine. be with whoever you want. and yet you're keeping me as a friend in spite of how i feel. you know how i feel. and yet you're keeping me around for... what? validation that life keeps dealing you a shit hand and you can't handle it without getting another person to agree with you? maybe you value me for some reason? maybe you're keeping me around for some unfathomable reason, i dunno. whatever the case... i think its malicious. i can't even tell anymore.      and i resent you for it.      i'm trying to move on with life and you made my journey damn near impossible. i couldn't even date others without dealing with the thoughts of you.      and i resent you for it.      you should've let me go the moment you told me someone took advantage of your newly single status. you didn't let me go. you know how i felt. sure, i would've been hurt and in pain, but i wouldn't have been in as much pain as i am right now. you seem happy and you didn't even see what i saw when you told me you had someone new. you knew them for a shorter time than anyone else and suddenly they're your new someone? you're a hypocrite.      and i resent you for it.

"it's all i have but i will give it to you, please just have the abortion".      she's not too keen on the idea, but she was leaning towards an abortion before he made the offer. she doesn't like the idea of taking life, but has 3 children already and with all the other health and emotional stress in her life as it is, it makes the most sense.       as far as i'm concerned, my advice is to take the money and run. the abortion makes sense, and in the end is the best thing for her and her health. it's only 2-3 weeks into the pregnancy.  i'm not nut's right?

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	when they highlight someone who's a member of a minority community, it's showing that diversity is strength. if their opponents do it, it's tokenism. they are experts at calling things they do entirely different things when their opponents do them in order to imbue them with an inherent 'evilness'.       look at this true believer who was unfortunate enough to take their echo chamber reinforced ideas and actually try to apply them over in r/conservative as they start their brigade:      > it's because y'all hate black people, but you're using this minstrel show you've concocted to make bad-faith counterarguments against your racism. you're tokenizing her. we aren't calling her a token.      this shit is riddled with progressive fundamentalist dogma. first, 'y'all' hate black people is used as the basis of their argument, it's just obviously true, and that's what makes what they're doing tokenism. it's classic circular reasoning. because you hate black people, your highlighting of a black woman who agrees with you is tokenism, which proves you hate black people. attempting to disprove racism just further proves how racist you are.      once again 'bad faith' is invoked to mean, i don't like your argument so i get to dismiss it as fake entirely on the basis of me not liking it. and then the final lie 'we aren't calling her a token'. then name of their brigade posts is literally 'tokenism intensifies'.

(troops to columbia, coup in venezuela, push back against brics nations?)      are there domestic operations being planned in which the government will need to restrict the outflow of us citizens and capital/gold?  (after 9/11 there were increased restrictions on liquidity and travelling internationally with cash and gold).      trump is the loudest and most recent, but this has been a long term bipartisan effort to militarize the border (operation gate keeper).      does anyone have any theory as to what treachery is being currently planned where this very expensive border wall could be useful?

Neutral	i'm not sure if this is actually a thing or not but i'm going to break down each of memorable highs.      first time getting high: grade 10, at lunch time. i couldnt walk, couldnt stand, barely could speak and sat in the woods for little over 4hours. i was generally afraid for my life and was listening to christian music thinking i was going to die. finally some chick came over and helped me get home which i fellasleep and felt super exhausted when i woke up.      second big high: smoked with a lot of friends and played fortnite, generally felt pretty good. i could only focus on one thing however, but when i focused on it i felt like i could really understand it. we were listening to music and i felt my ears could feel the beat in them (like the trap nation logo in their videos but in my ears). if i rubbed my arms i could feel that same feeling over and over again even though i stopped doing it. felt like my heart was pumping very fast and i was biting down hard on my teeth. i came to the conclusion that what i'm feeling is from the high, almost like a lucid high (??) like i was awareness what i was feeling was from a high and i could control my high because i control my brain. if i opened my mouth i could still feel the feeling of my clenching my jaw, if i stopped putting my hand over my heart i could still feel my heart pounding. i could stop and continue effects, almost like i was coding my brain to stop and start whatever i wanted to do.      last big high and last time smoking (2 weeks ago): 16% thc prerolls i bought at the liquor store, couldnt even finish the whole joint, got half way before i threw it out. i had to find an activity i could do because if i kept to myself i felt like i would get lost in my mind and eventually die. it felt like i was connecting all the dots to life, i had to snap myself out of thinking too much because it made me want to fallasleep and at the time falling asleep = death. i had to keep my mind away of thinking about my high, if i thought about it my heart felt like it would speed up, like a wheel and it would get faster and faster and then eventually it felt like someone was whipping my consicous, i'd think about something and then i'd hear the crack of a whip and the thought would be gone. i felt like my sober self was fighting my high self to see who could keep conscious and it was exhausting. i had to keep throwing out thoughts because i'd spiral farther down and couldnt stop myself. i tried watching brooklyn 99 but i kep imagining my life as a movie, and what would someones reaction would be to what i was doing right now, then i'd imagine my reaction to me thinking about my life as a movie and the cycle would continue. i tried taking a shower but it felt too good and relaxing, it felt like my legs were telling my brain that they were done standing and going to give out soon. overall it was like each part of my body was its own body and they all were trying to communicate at the same time. then i decided to play fortnite and lol, first couple of games were rough but then i decided that if i control my brain i'll force myself to get into the perfect state of mind to play, so i did. just thinking about the right state of mind allowed me to get in it, and i played the best i've ever played in my life.       what are my theories? i must be triggering some receptor or something in my brain that causes a episode. but i also think that while i'm high i control more of my brain because the thc receptors in my brain is filled up rather than being empty normally (if thats how it works). i generally believe that i can overdose on marijuana, and i want to get my brain checked out while i'm high, i'm fine with being the first person to od on marijuana if it furthers the research.       so what do ya'll think? i'm up for any questions.

Neutral	bush:       > i am at peace with myself. it irritates me a great deal to consider the indifference of the europeans to the sufferings that saddam hussein inflicts on iraqis. perhaps because he is brown-skinned, far away, and muslim, many europeans think that everything is all right in his regard. i will not forget what solana once said to me: why do we americans think that the europeans are anti-semitic and unable to confront their responsibilities?

Neutral	> for far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, i'm tired of it, and every single muslim in this country should be tired of it. cair was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. so you can't just say that today someone is looking at me strange and that i am trying to make myself look pleasant. you have to say that this person is looking at me strange, i am not comfortable with it, and i am going to talk to them and ask them why. because that is the right you have.      here's the context.  disregarding the issue that most of what she said in that paragraph is wrong, please explain what's changed by the context.  is she not referring to the terrorist attacks on 9/11 as "some people did something"?

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	the people commenting are crazy, but the article is bad, too. is it suggesting that because the republicans followed the constitution and appointed two judges (to replace two similarly minded judges, so it didn't cause too much political shift) it is not fair and so the laws should be changed to let the democrats pack the court? democrats sound like the kid that makes up rules to play ground games so that they don't lose.

Neutral	that's a real shame. i don't blame you. i think that cat has anxiety or some other issues that need to be dealt with. if anything dogs scare me just because of their size.       i (reluctantly at first) have 2 cats with my wife. both are very loving. one in fact wants nothing more than to snuggle and literally hug anyone who comes over.       but hey, we are definitely allowed to not be fond of something. i have a weird relationship with animals. they've always loved me. i can't tell you how many times i've heard that this cat or bird or dog doesn't like anyone and almost immediately wants to snuggle with me.

Neutral	the problem is that the profit incentive is really on the side of the anti vaxxers. vaccinations make up a tiny portion of pharmaceutical company income because they are only administered once or a few times during a customer's life.      however, people can make tons of money selling scams and conning desperate and/or idiotic anti vaxxers out of their money. alternative medicine likes to present itself as the friendly alternative to big pharma, but the truth is: it is a type of big pharma.

Neutral	most of reddit is
Neutral	didn't some complete imbecile post something to this effect on tumblr or twitter? - and now a new statesman writer picks it up and decides this is edgy journalism.  i find that men and women alike walk into me when i don't step aside. it's nothing to do with gender, it's just whether the person has respect for others - and in crowded city centres a lot of people don't. when someone sees someone walking straight at them they, they tend to think 'fuck you' and stand their ground.

Neutral	lost to a farmer. again.
Neutral	*thank you*. that's why it annoys me whenever i see people complaining that more people don't consume enough media made by [insert minority demographic here]. like, how about we just listen to what we think is good, because people have no control over their true race, gender, and sexuality, but they can control what media they produce.

Neutral	ss: trumps warhawks are laying groundwork for invasion but already we see the progressive faction of young politicians refuses to go along with it. here a lazily concocted story claiming maduro burned aid trucks is falling apart under scruitny. obviously deep state warhawks did not expect scrutiny from the otherwise complicit msm... it seems that the new progressive politicians have given the nytimes the courage to scrutinize once more. i hope this is the end of the msm colluding with the deep state to censor opposition to foreign wars!
Neutral	okay, so i know there's a million posts on here and online in general regarding cell phones listening to consumers, and most of what i've read consists of individuals noting eerie advertisements on facebook, youtube, and other platforms after having even mere conversations as a trigger.      my story is a little different though, and i felt like i have to share and hear other people's' inputs.      so my story begins with me having *ahem* intimate relations with my loving girlfriend. nothing interesting or out of the ordinary there. we were maybe a little louder than normal because no one else was home, but otherwise a standard occurrence. afterwards, we're both starving and decided we wanted to order a pizza.       so i grab my phone and click the url to highlight, and my keyword suggestions are "ego-dynastic sexual orientation" and "sexual intercourse." and what's particularly odd about that is it wasn't a safari suggestion (i have an iphone 8), but an actual keyword suggestion on my keyboard. trying to replicate that wasn't easy, and i had to search the former and take a screenshot of those suggestions to give an idea of what i saw.      regardless,  it's very possible that something similar has happened to me before, but the fact that i wasn't even really talking about anything sexual other than moaning, and my phone making suggestions for what it did seems eerily similar to what people describe in their experiences with those facebook ads.      anyone else have a similar experience? no words spoken, but still receiving suggestions based on situational circumstances?  this kinda creeped me out but maybe i'm just overthinking it.      thanks reddit!

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	empathy seems to be going by the wayside, it's a   quality we're encouraged not to embrace. and this modern age of ours is not helping things much with on demand everything. very little room for engagement. i tried to see things their way and gain a different perspective. went to the churches. shot the guns. listened to their pundits. i never felt welcomed or challenged to change my view. i only ever encountered entrenched hostility from these folks. and the sad thing is that a lot of the ideology isn't even what we're up against. for some of the older folks sure, but the younger people seem to have this need for attention and engagement that isn't even political, or for the sake of displaying their platform.  it's not for me.

Neutral	it should be noted that "death of the author" (which uh... is also a pun on malory's "morte d'arthur" for some reason) came as a reaction to earlier schools of criticism: it is, itself, not something that's just ahistorical and timeless, nor is it "the only right way to approach a text" or some such: it is broadly useful, but not neccessarily in all situations and in all contexts.

Neutral	i really hope the wpd void in my heart is eventually filled. i discovered the sub ~4 years ago after going through a rough breakup and it really helped open my eyes to appreciate what we have in life. i found myself being safer on the streets and more cautious around mopeds because i know how random accidents can occur. its members provided great insight to what they experience in the field. the community seemed more like a group of first responders from all walks of life rather than a cesspool like liveleak or bestgore. by banning these subs, the website is essentially pushing its members directly towards these cesspools too. i've found the discord and saidit have been comforting but i'm waiting to find all the past members we've lost. it's disheartening.          life is a fragile thing and many lose theirs without a tear shed so where does that leave us?

Neutral	drivers rarely get punished for running over bicyclists (or pedestrians) in this car-centric society, if they weren't drunk at the time.      there was this really horrible case in miami a few years back that was the exception: some douchebag was leaving the club at 8 am on sunday morning and ran into someone riding his bike on key biscayne. the driver didn't stop, and actually *kept going* all the way home with parts of the destroyed bike on his front bumper. he not only killed someone but did a hit-and-run, probably so he could sober up before the cops got to him. they had to confiscate his passport before he was sentenced so he didn't flee the country.      it turns out the driver was this two-bit aspiring singer that had performed at my university once. your standard acoustic guitar type. i got a signed ep from him but never ended up listening to it before this shit went down, and after that never would.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	this isn't even the most absurd tbh. a bunch of models accused trump of walking in on them backstage to creep, including underage models.      trump denied it, the campaign smeared them, then a video surfaced of trump, on tape, bragging about going back stage to creep on models:      > [URL]      the sad reality is his supporters tune all of this out.  most of them likely don't even know he got caught on tape admitting to doing the shit he was accused of by multiple models, including teenagers.      the guy is a massive creep. i not for one second doubt the sexual assault accusations against him, but there's a difference between knowing something is probably true and being able to prove it.      we're living in a time period where a retard  can just blatantly lie, get caught on tape proving he lied, and nobody seems to care.

Neutral	i dunno, i think for a lot of people, it's their first introduction to "thoughtful" sci-fi or "thoughtful" literature. it's a gateway drug to reading something not terrible like heinlein or asimov or watts.       i mean of course his work is ya and very simplistic, but it's not *as* awful as like harry potter, any of the 20000 ya dystopia novels, or something, where there's literally no moral or thought beyond "be good people!" or "your friends are important!"

Neutral	does this count as [off my meta] if i'm complaining about stuff on this sub?      based on my own personal experience and other posts i've seen, i would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the op for venting views they do not like. i get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and i'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. i've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. however, far too often do i notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. i suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. attack the argument, not the person.      basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like "you're not really x" or "you're fake and a troll". that's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. it's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. it's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. for example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? if they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. it's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub.      given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that offmychest wouldn't allow, i would expect better of people here. i dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that offmychest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views.      so, disagree with me on this if you must, but i think it would be better to debunk my arguments rather than claim i'm a fake and thus, that alone is somehow supposed to invalidate everything i've written.

Neutral	the fact that she decides not to pursue a masters degree and subsequently blames that on "white supremacy" suggests a mind boggling absence of even the most basic forms of self awareness. she allows a perceived slight to her woke sensibilities to determine her fate and excuses herself using the default woke scapegoat. if it weren't for "white supremacy", she'd have to face up to the fact that "gender studies" isn't a very sought after discipline. now she can blame this and all future failures on the great white boogyman.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	no, it doesn't make any sense. are those white people coming from countries with no or poor document control, known for exporting terrorists under forged paperwork?      i know nuance is subtle, but it was everyone coming from said 5 or 6 countries, not just muslims. oh, and muslim isn't a fucking color either.

Neutral	for someone trying to break down life to eugenics or science, you don't seem to like much less understand biology or science.      yes, humans have biological, scientific urges for good food, sex, companionship etc. - and those things then trigger biological, scientific reactions along the lines pleasure, satisfaction - from combinations of which we try to rationalize and derive concepts like "joy".       so say, enjoying good food, is an entirely rational contributor to "joy".      so you've just fooled yourself into thinking that "science" or the like requires an absence of emotion or feeling or the like, when of course emotion, feeling, other human reactions etc. are entirely natural.

Neutral	perhaps it's a caricature of how they see themselves
Neutral	this ebook is designed to explain the essential aspects of intervention theory that anyone new to it, or interested in learning more about it, will need to know.      every point discussed is supported by facts in available research, but are often criticized by skeptics. why? because the issues discussed are long-lived sacred cows to mainstream sciences.       the evidence shows that life on did not spontaneously appear, that it could not develop the way it did by "macro-evolution", and that "god did it" is not satisfactory either.  the evidence is best explained by terraforming - that advanced extraterrestrial beings directed the development of earth to support and sustain life.

IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	that's exactly what a manlet would say      what i would give to kidnap a midget like you and make his life a living hell. i would force him to dress up in elf and leprechaun outfits and subject him to pure awfulness and humiliation. just terrible degradation and shameful acts. it would be so easy to break his spirit and drive him to suicide, but i wouldn't let him do it. if i could train a dog to rape on command then i would totally do that as well. a really big dog like a mastiff. he would be so completely and utterly powerless to stop it, not to mention terrified. a big ass dog is even scary and life-threatening to a normal human but to a midget? might as well be a dragon. i'd keep him in a cell and what's more is that i would actually place to key inside with him but put it in a high place. not extremely high but just ever so slightly out of reach. it would drive him mad. i would dress him like a baby and force feed him 99 cent store baby food. i'd also pick him up like a child and toss him from one corner to the next. i'd grab him by one leg and swing him as hard and as fast as i could then hurl him to see how far he goes. i'd rent one of those giant inflatable bounce houses and body slam him all day until my arms got tired. i'd hold him down with 1 hand and slowly stick things up his butt just to see him squirm. i would stick him in dryers and turn them on and leave him in there for long periods of time. i'd force him to fight other midgets to the death. just so many things i would do.

Neutral	no worries, thanks for talking to them.      maybe you're right, i'll have to take a look at the sub and check out the structure. from my experience most the bigger subs are just extremely left leaning, so maybe i jumped to that conclusion too fast. will have to look into it a bit more.

Neutral	jolyne was great wtf?
Neutral	why?
PersonDirectedAbuse	or your just standing up against a powerful entitie like the government that have no shred of honor and will use every unfair dirty trick know to mankind. so the only realistic way to fight them back is to use guerilla warfare and stick to the shadows i.e. concealing ur identity.      is just your latest comment. and rule1 doesn't mean that they're saying you're being uncivil, it means you're trying to start a debate, which the sub isn't for. "rule 1. this subreddit is for civil discussion not heated debate." and you have a couple of different subs that are for debating. different subs for different purposes.      as for your argument. you're addressing why there might be a legitimate reason for fear, but in the end, that's still you being a coward and a legitimate reason to fear doesn't change that.
Neutral	tucutephopic, what does that mean?
Neutral	this is a really interesting and healthy debate, actually. whom should we blame for the white supremacist economic policies and culture we have?      are super racist, kkk type people more numerous and powerful than we realized? or is it a natural side-effect of poorly regulated capitalism where existing imbalances in wealth distribution are perpetuated to benefit those in power?

Neutral	honest question here, how do people decide the general consensus on whether a word is offensive to a community or not? i can perfectly understand and agree with not using a word towards people if they say they don't like to be referred to that way, but how do we determine what is wrong to a much larger group?      i think the thing that confuses me the most about "trap" as to whether it is offensive or not, is that the only times i ever see it used in reference to real people or in real life is for nsfw purposes, and i think, at least in my experience,  people have very different definitions on whether something is offensive when it's being used explicitly for those scenarios.       i guess the long and short of it is, i can fully see and agree with how it would be offensive in just a normal setting, but i'm not sure if it would be offensive if it's being used mainly for nsfw purposes, which is what it is as far as i know.

PersonDirectedAbuse	i agree. not all fathers are good fathers. it would be a gross generalisation to claim that.      just as it's a gross generalisation by both authors that the majority of fathers have toxic masculinity, and that the majority of trump voters are suffering from "male resentment and entitlement".      both authors have very little credibility to be frank.      that having been said ... articles like this never acknowledge the good, they always zero in on what the author perceives as bad. they never seem to consider the father who (they claim) failed to do the things they are whining about had his own issues to deal with.       case in point:      >sexton, 37, grew up in linton, a dirt-poor, factory-family town in southern indiana, just southeast of terre haute.      given that fact, and the fact there is a photo of sexton and his (now crucified in public after his death) father at the daytona 500 in 2007, and given that nascar enjoys most of it's popularity amongst blue collar workers we can reasonably infer that sexton's father was working in a factory in a struggling town.      most likely working long hours, in a difficult job.      yet these regressives never acknowledge that in their haste to virtue signal. they never acknowledge the burdens their fathers endured *for their children's sake* in their pursuit of a narrative which bears little relation to reality.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	cishet destroys tranny with opinions and feelings.
Neutral	yeah i'm conflicted on this one. i don't think paid shilling/propaganda is good in any sense. however, there's a massive stigma against nuclear due to misinformation and lack of knowledge coupled with "nuclear" being a scary word.          nuclear is probably our best bet to clean up the environment on a timetable in decades as opposed to centuries. people being scared/uninformed about nuclear is a large reason as to why it hasn't been more widely adopted. if i remember correctly gallup did a poll and i think only 42% of dems and 42% of independents in the u.s were in support of nuclear. around 65% of reps were pro-nuclear, but that's still a significant portion against that needs to be lowered imo.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	by no means am i disagreeing the right is full of fuckwits but here on reddit you have to actively try to even find a "right wing narrative" where as you cant go to a video game subreddit, news subreddit, economic subreddit, meta subreddit, movie subreddit ect without getting hit in the face over and over and over with the "left wing narrative"       hence complaining about the right is the equivalent of being lost at sea and complaining being lost in a desert also would suck, as such it is technically correct but practically fucking useless.

Neutral	this is a stunning news article to read. it just shows *how far off track holland is, as a nation.*      everyone can make their decisions in life. once this girl started living on her own she could have done whatever she wanted to do to herself and no one could have stopped her. but for society to do it to her while she is still a child is the epitome of evil.      this action should be prosecuted in the hague as a crime against humanity.      if people stand behind this action, it would be political correctness gone mad. it's the same attitude that allows children to undergo self mutilation in surgery because they believe that they are a different gender.      there is a difference between a child and an adult. the mindset, the attitude, and the perspective of a child is inextricably connected with the adults in her life. adults have an effect on that child's decisions. therefore, it is an invalid idea that you can give a child "the right to die" under these circumstances.
Neutral	sometimes demographics of people's will be naturally excluded from certain things and that's not inherently bad. "anti-human rights" causes are the opposite of what chick-fil-a are doing with their "human right" of the freedom to associate with they choose.

Neutral	this is not a crazy sentiment.   jk rowling has for a while now been doing this thing where she announces outisde of the narrative that certain characters are "diverse" in whatever way, but diagetically in universe within the narrative of the world itself there is little to no evidence to back up these claims.   supposedly dumbledore and grindelwald had a passionate relationship-- but in a film very much about dumbledore and grindelwald this is explicitly only given as dumbledore initially having had admiration for grindelwald's philosophy - leading to their pact of not stopping one another - and how that got soured by grindelwald's genocidal side.       rowling has basically been cashing in on the diversity of her books/films without actually writing this diversity into them.   anf this frustrates the fans because if dumbledore and grindelwald's relationship was as rowling described in her tweets etc. then she is refusing to give the audience the real story by writing such a tame version of it in fb cog

Neutral	it's the hypocrisy/lack of empathy here that really gets me. she mentions being extremely uncomfortable around the large, boisterous 20-somethings staying in her neighbor's apartment (completely understandable given her trauma), but can't see why her elderly neighbors similarly aren't comfortable with a large dog running around in the hallways of their apartment complex off-leash.      even if op is willing to stake her reputation on the temperament of her pet, the _threat_ of a large dog wandering around that might without notice jump at/play rough with you in ways that are acceptable with 19-year olds but not with geriatrics is a detriment to her neighbor's quality of life. my uncle had a beautiful black lab when i was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin.      sorry for the rant but esas are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. there are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. however, just because your dog is classified as an esa _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. that dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. by bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. for a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems.       if you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an esa into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level.      **edit:** wanted to clarify something because i went from "unconditional love" to "social contract" in the same paragraph: if you adopt a dog and do the _bare minimum_ to keep it alive, that thing's gonna love the shit out of you. doesn't matter if it's overweight, sick, or whatever, that poor fuzzball doesn't know any better. if you are not doing these things as a dog owner it is my opinion that you are taking advantage of the poor animal that has placed its trust in you.

Neutral	okay, okay, okay.      • first of all, the backlash about captain marvel doesn't stem from the fact that's it's a first mcu movie with a female protagonist. it comes from the fact that mcu literally shoved that narrative down everyone's throats because *everyone needs to be 10.000% aware that it's a woman and women are strong and women fighters are powerful and good as men!* they campaigned the shit out of that narrative, and brie larson's virtue signalling commentary shortly before release did not help. it's not the movie that's the problem, it's the pr campaign that butchered the narrative of a female hero protagonist, and when the negative reviews started coming out, they censored them, because god forbid anyone has genuine criticism about the movie.      • second of all, did you forget about other female superhero or general female hero movies, or comics, or books? hellooooo....we can all name over a dozen hero protagonists that are women, no matter if marvel, or dc, or any general media, and they have been around for decades.

PersonDirectedAbuse	i think it's always good to check out the author of these articles. in this case it's myriam françois.      ooops! it turns out myriam is a regressive. who would have known?      how do i know? because she works for both the bbc and channel 4 in the uk. that in itself is remarkably good evidence, but wait, there's more!      myriam has been pushing a steady narrative about how oppressed mulims are in the uk for several years now (and making quite a little money out of it through her tv jobs and as a research associate at the centre of islamic studies (cis) at soas university, where her research focuses on british muslim integration issues).       given her deep concern for muslim women i figured i should read what myriam has to say about shaparak shajarizadeh and nasrin sotoudeh ... both sentenced to prison for daring to remove their headscarves in iran.      not a word.      that pretty much sums myriam up. she's profiteering off telling white people how evil they are ... and doesn't give the least shit about women who actually **are** being oppressed.

Neutral	unless someone's been murdered, i usually take alleged hate crimes with a grain of sugar and a grain of salt. the guy said he was attacked, okay. then the details seemed fishy, so i considered that perhaps it was a real attack but he falsified the details.      as the days passed it seemed more and more unlikely that white maga people were behind it, but i still kept that under consideration because, as the people on [USER] say, "truth is stranger than fiction". but at this point? there's no believing that narrative.

Neutral	it's a bit nuanced.  some people believe kneeling is disrespectful to the flag and to the soldiers who have fought and died.  others argue that's clearly not what the protest is about, it's about bringing attention to the issue of police brutality and murder of black people.  of course, the legitimacy of that issue is another discussion entirely.        in my opinion, i don't really give a fuck if you stand or kneel or put a fist up for the anthem.   my problem with the whole thing was that people felt the guy deserved to be a starting qb in the nfl, even though he sucked in his last season before he was cut.  and several teams brought him in for workouts, but ended up not signing him, because he wanted too much money and didn't want to be a backup.  basically, he either wanted to be a guaranteed starter and get paid, which was never gonna happen, or continue to portray a martyr for social issues and garner support/attention/money that way.  he recently sued the nfl for colluding against him, and they settled out of court.  he got less than $10 million, which is chump change for a lawsuit of that nature
Neutral	there is no "right" way to feel. do not guilt yourself for the type of feelings you're having plus the situation.       i believe people heal and deal so different. if your feelings feel right to you, only you can honestly say. stay in that space. continue being open and honest and now knowing what transpired, talk to your wife about how you move on and grow from this. find the positive and move forward.       obviously your wife was in a much different space and i hope she has gotten the help she needed to feel better.       good for you and i hope time co tiniest to help you heal.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	this entire discussion is why i'm centrist, both conservitives and liberals are so far up there own asses that they both can't see that they both suck ass, conservitives for being pushy assholes misguided by religion and liberals for being pushy assholes that live in an echo chamber. the reason i dislike liberals more though is because they are too emotional and kinda selfish, where as conservitives seem to be all about working hard to get what you want liberals are all about changing society to get what they want even if what they do is dangerous.

Neutral	this is one of the weaknesses with the tumblrites, if it really goes down to it.      if you're trying to create a better new world, wouldn't the people saying "we're bitter about society, and if you promise us sex in return we will do literally anything you say" be the perfect people to ally with?       why would you want to push the "these people are angry enough to kill, and they're simple-minded enough they'll do anything we ask if we promise them they'll get their pee pee wet in exchange" to the oppressors when you can use them to fight the oppressors?

IdentityDirectedAbuse	dumb whammys am i right
PersonDirectedAbuse	part of the trouble here is that the question posed by the artist-is-dead crowd, of which i am one, is not "what did the author mean," but rather, "what does this work say?" interpretation of a work of art should be a sound evaluation of the work, not of what the author has said about the work.      take, for example, ender's game, and the rest of orson scott card's ender series. in ender's game, there's a real bent toward multicultural tolerance, anti-xenophobia, support and compassion, all sorts of positive themes, and this is starkly at odds with scott card, who is himself a pretty awful bigot.      so the question, then, is not, "did scott card really mean the aliens to be a metaphor for people of other nations?" because the answer is probably no, scott card is an asshole, but it doesn't matter, because textual analysis of the book allows one to read exactly that metaphor out of it and to support that interpretation with textual evidence.      there are no critics taken seriously who derive nonsense from a work of art. internet message boards may be full of them, but actual art criticism demands that an interpretation be supported by the work itself.      there's a fantastic summary of the point in a piece of set dressing from the film birdman. on michael keaton's dressing room mirror is a small slip of paper which reads, "a thing is a thing, not what is said of it."

Neutral	## take 1: autonomous vehicles will kill transit / will change transit so profoundly that we might as well stop building transit and wait for them to rescue us.      we build transit for many reasons, but the *chief* reason is to move as many people as possible using as few resources as possible: this, in turn, makes commuting cheaper, and frees up certain resources (like road space, parking spaces, fuel, etc.) to relieve pressure on commuters who make other choices. this also helps make our cities work better: more transit, less traffic, more commerce, fewer accidents, fewer person-hours spent sitting in traffic, easier for law enforcement and emergency vehicles, ancillary benefits (better for the environment, conserve manufacturing resources, get around the city without a car...), everybody's a winner.      and autonomous vehicles have absolutely nothing to do with that. look at it like this:      how many subway trains does it take to move 1000 commuters? 1.      how many light rail vehicles does it take to move 1000 commuters? 5.      how many double-decker buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 13.      how many standard buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 20.      how many private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? in the united states, about 650. (as of 2018, most rush-hour private vehicles carried about 1.54 occupants.)      and how many autonomous private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? about 650.      which is to say, in any city large enough to support higher-order transit, *when it comes to the key reason we build transit*, transit will always beat autonomous vehicles.      when it comes to other situations -- rural areas, small towns, places where there simply isn't enough demand even to sustain a basic bus service -- autonomous vehicles will be a major boon. but in the big cities, the fundamentals for transit will remain strong.      ----      ## take 2: transit agencies in asia can turn a profit, so european and north american agencies should be able to do so as well.      insofar as transit agencies in asia turn a profit, they normally do so on their property holdings: they own the land above their stations, which gets turned into skyscrapers, which means dollars in their pockets. but this also means that these transit agencies aren't turning a profit *as transit agencies*.      i have a friend who plays the trombone. she makes $100,000 a year, which is a *lot* of money for a trombone player. of course, she makes that money by working as a *lawyer*. should we therefore go around to every trombone player and tell them off for not earning six figures?      ----      ## take 3: free transit would solve a lot of problems.      free transit is a great solution for smaller communities, especially in cases where the agency spends more money collecting fares than it receives in fares. (after all, fares don't just get deposited in the farebox: someone has to count them, someone has to print and issue tickets, someone has to draw up reports, someone has to do bank runs, the agency needs a secure room to hold the money and fare equipment, fareboxes themselves aren't free... if you spend $100,000 per year on collecting/counting/depositing/handling fares, but only make $50,000 in the farebox, you're a prime candidate for getting rid of them.)      free transit is also a fine solution if you want to address specific social needs or social problems. for example, a growing number of agencies offer free services on new year's night, and many also offer free services to and from major public events where drinking is commonplace. you might also offer free services between seniors' homes and shopping centres, or between campuses of a hospital or university. makes a lot of sense.      but studies consistently show that free transit does more harm than good in larger communities as a general service. specifically, free transit:      1. causes driver morale to plummet.   2. causes vandalism to skyrocket, which significantly increases maintenance costs and can also cause vehicle shortages. (if you're pulling 8 buses out of service due to vandalism every day, but you're only able to return 4 to service on an average day, you've got a bad problem.)   3. turns vehicles into homeless shelters on wheels.   4. attracts hooligans. (they can basically do whatever they want on the bus, and even if someone eventually forces them off... they can hop right on the next one.)   5. as a result of points 2, 3 and 4, free transit discourages "choice" ridership, and can actually increase the number of cars on the road. (if they don't feel safe and comfortable taking transit, people who can afford to drive instead will start choosing to do so.)   6. significantly increases law enforcement callouts, partly because it significantly increases assaults on drivers.      bottom line, it tends to do more harm than good. even just charging a small fare (50 cents or the like) does a significant amount to deter these behaviours. covering the farebox just unleashes it.      ----      ## take 4: my city has terrible transit. it's so much better in [x].      you think transit's better in new york, london, paris, chicago, san francisco, vancouver, toronto, berlin, sydney, whatever?      maybe it is: these cities do have more options and modes of transit than your average city. but go to that city's subreddit and i guarantee you'll see the same gripes and problems as your city: bus bunching, cancelled services, short-turns, confusing maps, disinterested drivers, etc.      don't confuse your three-day sojourn in, say, portland (during which you never travelled in rush hour, only visited downtown destinations, and took the streetcar just because you *could*...) for the reality of what people who actually live in that city put up with every day. if you had to commute from the suburbs to downtown, making two connections and consistently missing your bus, you would feel differently: in fact, you'd feel similarly to how you probably feel about your hometown's transit agency. you have my condolences for the inconvenience, but you also aren't so special.      ----      ## take 5: here's a cool technology: let's shoehorn it into our system without a rationale.      this goes for:      1. aerial tramways   2. monorails   3. people-movers   4. personal rapid transit   6. chinese straddling buses   5. river ferries   6. etc. etc. etc.      many of these technologies are *interesting*, but people tend to obsess over them to the exclusion of more sensible transportation modes. there are *specific situations* where these technologies may make sense (monorails are great for tourists, aerial tramways can move people across bodies of water or up mountainsides, river ferries are great in cities built up around the river, etc.), but simply building them for the sake of building them (someone decides "hey, aerial tramways are cool, we should build an aerial tramway!") means your city will dump billions of dollars into acquiring a white elephant. on the plus side, as the only user, you'll be able to take some sweet unobstructed photos!      when it comes to building higher-order transit (like monorails, people-movers, etc.), i've got a simple truism for you. you need one of two things:      1. a *lot* of cyclical demand, to such an extent that buses can't carry the load.   2. a *lot* of conter-cyclical demand: all-day traffic in all directions, steady demand all day long. usually this means linking a city centre with an amenity like a large university, a major intermodal transit hub, another city centre, a major shopping centre or district, a major tourist attraction, etc.      if you don't meet either criteria... stick to boring, bunchy, uninspiring buses. detroit hasn't really profited from investing millions of dollars in a people-mover. sydney wound up tearing out their monorail after years of disappointing results. new orleans built an aerial tramway which lasted less than a year in revenue service. save your money.

Neutral	look up difference between communist/socialist and welfare state      > in a capitalist society with a welfare system, there is a lower bound on people's benefits. if you are sick, unemployed or old, there would be a social security to guarantee you a minimum level of existence. however, there is no upper bound on how much a person achieve.      > in socialism, there is often a lower bound, but more importantly a very strong upper bound. there is a strong compulsion to not allow anyone to get too rich, by the government controlling all methods of production.      > there is an absolute poverty and a relative poverty. if people are dying/suffering without the basic necessities [such as food, clothing, shelter] there is absolute poverty. if some are a lot rich and others not so rich, then there is relative poverty. welfare capitalism worries primarily about absolute poverty, while socialism worries more about relative poverty. for capitalist it often doesn't matter that there is wealth inequality, because those are natural [not all gets olympic medals, nobel prizes, honor, awards for instance]. for a socialist, inequality is a problem.      > a capitalist nation with a welfare system is pretty much capitalism. there is no fundamental change. it is just that the government provides an additional service - an insurance against abject poverty.
Neutral	its sickening to see models promote eating disorders or photoshop as body positivity or what "looks good." anorexia is not ok. obesity is not ok. i am not talking about the people who are naturally skinny or thicker or if its to raise awareness due to some type of thyroid issue or etc. i'm talking about the ones who are not willing to change their lifestyle (like they eat too much junk food) and become healthier for their own sake. instead of encouraging such behaviors, people should encourage them to get  the necessary medical help.      on top of that body positivity should be embracing your natural body type. whether it be a pear, banana, apple, hourglass or etc. fashion designers make different styles that cater to different body types. its ridiculous when people get upset when an outfit doesn't look good on them, when its not for their body type to begin with. embracing their body type is the best way to figure out what makes them look beautiful. like wearing a size 4 when they're really a size 14. not only do they make themselves look bad but it gives them a harder/very uncomfortable time forcing themselves in spanx and corsets. do yourself a favor and wear clothes that work for you, don't wear it just bc its what so and so wore or its what society wants. everyone is beautiful or handsome in their own unique ways.       off course, being outright rude is never acceptable. thats just being an a*shole

Neutral	>bike riders have *more* of a right to be on the road than drivers do.        this makes no sense. all members of the public, especially citizens of a specific area, have equal right to be using the roadway. it's not the bike or the car that's using the road - it's the person.      >cycling on public roads is a right.  automobiles, on the other hand, are there by license only.        you are trying to use a very convoluted happenstance - driver's licenses - to try and make a normative point here, but it falls flat because the point has no merit. in other words, this makes no sense.       >driving is not a right.   and neither is cycling on the road. yes, you don't have to get a cycling license, but that has nothing to do with it being or not being a right - and everything to do with the fact that automobiles are far more dangerous to other people than bicycles are. but at the end of the day, if some jurisdiction wanted to restrict the ability of people to cycle on the roads, they absolutely could, and there would be no legal standard of "it's an inviolable right" stopping them, the way it would was something like freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, freedom of religion, etc - at least in the united states.

Neutral	what's funny is that this would probably be a very effective method of discouraging suicide. most suicides want death but they don't want a messy or painful death -- there's a reason for that. even though they want to die, they still care about dignity, they still care about being "proper" and "responsible" with the undertaking. a woman would most likely not be able to bear the fact that her mother would see not only her corpse but also her corpse being ravaged by some weirdo. hell, she wouldn't even be able to bear that herself (even though she would be dead and couldn't deal with that anyway).

Neutral	no need to downvote me. i was just telling you you got banned for a legit reason. it doesn't matter what you think of the sub. the sub has a rule and you broke the rule. if you don't like that the rule contradicts the sub oh well. i forget the name of another sub but the rule is similar to whichever one i'm thinking of. there's some creepy or horror related sub where people talk about some event they experienced. they're supposedly true. most, if not all, are obviously not true but people who are into that stuff like to go there for the fun of it. if they believe in the paranormal it makes it even more realistic and more in depth for them.      if there's a rule against calling out something as bullshit people there are obviously well aware there's a lot of bullshit on the sub but go there anyways.
Neutral	> i could give two shits about anyone else besides myself.      this is the proper response regardless of whether you got a cut or not.
Neutral	oprah might be smart but she still hasn't figured she being is used by stedman, as the only african american woman to own a tv network showed poor judgement to call it own.
Neutral	you win some, you lose some.
Neutral	they're usually referring to the latter when they say that (and they do the same with bisexuals). it's some weird r/gatekeeping they do because they can't seem to understand the concept of someone not being heterosexual, yet not chasing after the same sex. it's extremely weird.

Neutral	workers get hurt, workers go to doctor, workers tell doctor they have to keep working or else they lose everything, the doctor provides painkillers so worker can stay functional or active. it's a cycle, and then they make sure they give the worker enough of a supply 30-60 pills, which is the perfect amount to develop a slight addiction.      legit don't know how you misread my comment to think i'm saying companies are giving meth and opiates to their employees, because that's not what i was speaking about.
Neutral	i just....what?
Neutral	thanks. currently got my heating pad going full blast and some medication in me.
Neutral	what would provoke that? major wars aren't fought that way anymore. russia wanted to "war" with the eu so they destabilized syria and flooded europe with refugees from all over the middle east. usa is toppling a regime in venezuela right now - no us military is going to attack anyone. i can't imagine what would prompt an actual land war between the us and anyone in europe

IdentityDirectedAbuse	these replies are embarassing and these null orbiting faggots need to leave

Neutral	if you're offering advice to people just to get recognition that you're doing a good deed, you're in the wrong. they have no obligation to respond to you, whether it's a simple thank you or something more in depth. leaving a well thought out response on a serious topic is a thankless act. you should be doing it purely out of consideration for op.      should we get pissed at you for not responding to all of our comments on your post u/sandman1025?... ^((noooooooooo))
Neutral	the funny thing here is that people were protesting the restaurant because the owner was using funds to support anti-gay rights groups, but i believe the owner stopped that practice because of the protesting. now, it's just hearsay, but i'm not sure the original owner is even charge anymore. i had heard that he turned it over, but i could be wrong.      the point is that chick-fil-a doesn't fund political groups anymore so i say we eat chicken tendies and move on.

Neutral	give me a link to this threat op. i'm about a drop a r/murderedbywords on this fool
Neutral	i'm actually going out on a limb here and going to suggest "zorro" does actually reference the pulp character zorro. kinda like pizza think of how many kids loved disney's zorro. it was a huge, huge cash cow for disney back in the late 50s. i (a 23 y/o) even sit down and watch the old episodes sometimes. so think what that would mean to a kid if a stranger offered to take them to "zorro ranch." how far does this go back?      again, i'm just going out on a limb without any hard facts. but yes, zorro would be the thing that would attract a kid even if it only applied to 50's kids.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	sjws are unironic white saviours with no self awareness. they appoint themselves as arbiters of what is and isn't racist to different races, without permission.
Neutral	i don't see how you can discount the accuracy when determining it's usefulness. yes, it can 2hko instead of 3hko if all moves hit, but you won't ko at all if you miss.       vgc has a lot of battles, taking into account power like this makes sense to me since you'll be playing enough battles that the accuracy will affect how at least one battle goes.

Neutral	nothing the pictures say excludes trans men, though. both the person in the screenshot and teen vogue are making the exact same statement, and the person in the screenshot somehow doesn't get that. "not all people who have periods are women" and "women are not the only ones who menstruate" are just slightly different ways of wording the exact same sentence.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	that argument is retarded anyway considering the fact that i highly doubt people in the military would kill their own families over something they joined the military in part to protect.

Neutral	he was not actually thrown in real life but historically he still had a reputation for incompetence even being rumored to be brain damaged well before the novel. take the records with a grain of salt though as chinese characterizations of historical figures are usually subject to intense revisionism. after the conquest of shu he basically kept his head down, made friends with the sima clan and lived a seemingly happy life in the capital on a government pension. for a former emperor that's unambitious as hell and insulting to your former subjects but it kept him and his family alive.

PersonDirectedAbuse	submission statement: biden staffers  claim his campaign is not organized and "half-assed".  biden is an obvious establishment tool, exactly the thing that defeated hillary.  the videos of him touching kids are the final nail in the coffin.  yet he is promoted as the front-runner (much like jeb! was) despite his obviously doomed campaign. he will draw all the flak and just as the primaries begin, tulsi gabbard will surge out of nowhere.  the cfr member is anti-war and being persecuted by the msm, so she will have anti-establishment credibility (like barak did).  she can take over from biden as a welcome change, and sanders will get told to toe the line again.

Neutral	in my opinion, it's a mix of misinformation, heavy social conservatism, and a need to hate a group and see them as below yourself (but being too much of a pussy to go all the way and directly hate on the gays or brown people, because that might get you actual backlash and is harder to internally justify).

Neutral	that's why many people say he ruins subs, he posts "interesting" stuff to unrelated subs, people just browsing will upvote without looking at what sub it's from.      and the result is subs losing their meaning.
Neutral	liu bei was quoted as saying his something along the lines of wives and children and like armor but his brothers in arms were his arms and legs. he did swear an oath in the peach garden to two complete strangers at the time. they swore to unite china, and to die on the same day, same month, and same year. this actually didn't happen. with guan yu dying first, then zhang fei. i've played all the romance of the three kingdoms and dynasty warriors and briefly read romance. liu bei's true problem as i saw it was that he didn't listen to his counsel from the smartest minds in china at that time( zhuge liang, pang tong) to name a few. he had every conceivable opportunity to unite china, his generals were some of the greatest talents in the land, many of his generals were said to be worth 1000 of men. (guan yu, zhang fei, zhao yun, ma chao, huang zhong) but he failed to follow through at crucial moments because how he would be seen by the people. liu bei son a dou or liu chan was a completely useless emperor. he had no military experience due to him inheriting the empire during the three kingdoms deadlock( a time when wei, wu, and shy were already formed) so at the time no kingdoms risked massive battles because each kingdom was dug in defense wise. liu chan continues his father mistakes by not completely heeding zhuge liang and not sending the troops and supplies to him and jiang wei. he wasted his empires wealth on nonsense( parties, temples, clothes, his wives) etc.

Neutral	i don't live in california.       homeless people find a way to get to california for the climate. california is widely agreed to have the most temperate climate of any us state and has the most "pleasant" days of any state.  they also offer better services for homeless people than most other states.      everything you've described is certainly a problem and steps need to be taken to reduce homelessness and its associated problems.

Neutral	i think my favorite observation about star wars from rlm went something like "they took a great trilogy of summer blockbusters form the 80s and turned them into a massive expanded universe. it's like if someone had taken the back to the future trilogy and tried to create an expanded universe out of it, and other people had devoted their life to the back to the future expanded universe."

IdentityDirectedAbuse	well for one, there is a good chance there is something wrong with you if you have no sexual attraction to anyone. you may be asexual, but you may also have a hormonal imbalance or other underlying medical condition you should have investigated. also, what you're describing is the human condition. there isn't a person alive that hasn't thought there was something wrong with them. i don't think thats a unique experience in the slightest. we may as well include people with ibs or underactive thyroids in the lgbt umbrella if this is the bar being set.       secondly, there is no such thing as aromantic. that is not an orientation. romantic partnering is a cultural creation, not a biological reality. this has been studied. there is a great deal of variability from culture to culture. some cultures have primarily homosocial intimate pairings and sexual relationships are separate and primarily for procreation and recreation. so aromantic is not an orientation at all.

Neutral	there are a few ways to go about disproving a literary theory. for instance if the story was written before star trek was a thing. you could look for whether red has a stronger connection to something else, or if it's colors in general.      just make a stronger argument. "it's coincidence" is basically the null hypothesis and it doesn't make for great discussion because you can assume that about any claim, but it can still be accurate. you just need to have an argument for *why* you think it's coincidence. you put in the work to show exactly how the evidence provided is flimsy or the connection weak.      >it's really hard to prove them wrong, even if they don't have any evidence or compelling reason.       if the argument and evidence is really that weak it shouldn't be all that difficult to demonstrate it. tell them *why* the evidence is weak. is the color red used elsewhere besides shirts? was the story written before star trek was a thing, etc.       part of literary analysis is being able to articulate arguments against other theories and supposing your own.
Neutral	it's never a surprise people who post these kinds of "fuck everybody, i'm going to go eat fried worms" posts have a miserable time on reddit.  reddit definitely has a toxic shithole element, but that's not why these folks are having a bad time. frequently, these posters seem incapable of reading the room. they know they're one of the *good* ones, and assume their wonderful thoughts will be lots of karma and internet praise. if they're downvoted or receive critical responses, they never ask themselves if they're being weirdly hostile, or if they're actually contributing the conversation. it's always reddit's fault, not their own.
Neutral	me neither.

Neutral	that mod post is extremely questionable. i'm glad to see  a commenter saying how it's not a good idea to censor the discussion because the only ones who benefit from that are people who would suppress the rights of non-binary folk.      it's also super against the spirit of one piece as a whole to avoid discussion of the designated "strange" or "undesirable". "othering" is a major issue in one piece, it's the crux of two of the new world arcs and pretty significant to katakuri on whole cake island. it is very dumb to ban potential discussion of it.

Neutral	3d tv is pretty much dead. as far as i know, there is no one out there currently making 4k tvs that also do 3d.      there was a bit of overlap between the start of the mass-market push for 4k tv and the end of the 3d tv gimmick, so 4k 3d tvs did exist. if you're really that into the idea you might be able to track one down. i don't know if it would be worth it for you though, because i'm not sure if anyone produced 4k 3d content. what i remember is a lot of multi-disc sets that would include one 4k blu-ray and a separate 3d blu-ray.

Neutral	resentment isn't pain lmao
Neutral	google had blacklisted t_d long before the quarantine.
Neutral	unsarcastically: the idea of "pride" for oppressed or disadvantaged groups is a celebration of overcoming the oppression and disadvantage. it's a collective pride in having made it this far while putting up with all the shit. it's not the only requirement in order to be proud of yourself or celebrate collective accomplishment, but it can definitely be a legitimate source of pride.      there's not much pride in distinctions of no consequence or ones that are advantages unearned, because there was no hurdle to clear, nothing really achieved. that's why "straight pride" sounds silly or obnoxious, depending on the baggage. this isn't to say "straight shame" is legitimate either, just "straight... is an adjective which applies" is more the right speed.
Neutral	when i see people litter, i just ask them if they love china. when they inevitably say yes, of course, i ask them why they just chucked rubbish on it. you can see their programming freezing up and rebooting a few times, but they usually pick it up.

Neutral	well they think they can get away with it and they are right for the most part, especially in the east, because their electorate (mainly rurals and elders) cares only about two things: keeping brown migrants out and having their welfare benefits perpetually raised, their electorate also understands growing up during socialism that corruption, stifling of opportunities for young people and a bit of authoritarianism is a necessary part of it
Neutral	that's true. i heard that.

Neutral	yeah, the problem is that he's using a single large company's balance sheet to draw that conclusion.       1. concessions have a higher profit margin (from a purchase v sales perspective) but a lower volume wrt total revenue.      2. ticket sales have a lower profit margin (from a purchase v sales perspective) but a much higher volume wrt total revenue      the problem is so many other factors are not accounted for, not the least of which a large theater chain having a lot to gain from inflating profits from ticket sales. plus overhead, labor, and the fact that not every movie theater in 2019 is amc in 2009.

Neutral	true, but that's because big tech is expressly neoliberal. this means their censors will filter some far-left content they find objectionable, but that's because their main target is anything that questions the established order.      which, far more often than not, is the right, and especially the dissident right.
Neutral	there are a couple of problems here.      firstly - while it's the first 'picture of a black hole', it's not. i've seen numerous images in the past which explored gravitational lensing, and the plasma jets associated with black holes. i'm not minimising the achievement here, but as always the mainstream press are singularly clueless and screw up any story about science.      secondly - there were indeed a number of stories and narratives that singled out katie bouman and pushed her part in the story out of context and out of proportion. let us note that all of the media who did this are also  media who have been labelled regressive and biased.       from the washington post: *meet katie bouman, the young woman behind the first image of a black hole*      from cnet: *meet katie bouman, the woman who transformed our view of black holes forever*      the bbc: *katie bouman: the woman behind the first black hole image*      cnn: *that's where bouman's algorithm — along with several others — came in*      having pushed their distorted narrative they then left katie to be the one to suffer the kickback for it.      now let us note the following. i think this image is a major step forward and was very excited about it. not as excited as i was when cern had their announcement about the higgs boson, but excited just the same.      furthermore i think everyone involved, including katie bouman and the subteam she lead, should be extremely proud and deservedly so.      and i think that any harassment that katie bouman may be receiving is bullshit. and it's very clear that the mainstream media are to blame for creating the situation.

Neutral	the really shitty thing is, they might be right about it being *going* to happen. you tell and entire generation of young white men from the time they're in pre-school through college that all the world's problems are their fault, that they owe their money, slot in college, job, and everything else to other people just because of their skin color, tell them that being white is evil, etc and you just might end up turning a lot of those boys, who otherwise would have been fine, into actual racists. sometimes i wonder if that is actually one of the left's goals. when you don't have an enemy to fight and seem like the hero, just create one.

Neutral	i don't know who downvoted me. last i read about this all i noticed that in the us, you don't have a mandatory base. those 700 do not cover the same as those who pay more. in switzerland, everybody receives the same basic care and there are only differences in service from the insurers and cantonal/geographic differences (usual thing about big systems being differently effective and all).     so my question: do those 730 have the same coverage as those 1200? if so, then yes, it is scandalous in the other direction, if not, why is there a 730 option?

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i suppose it's just a visceral reaction. like my aversion to coprophilia or bestiality. i find the concept of two men sodomising each other to be sickening. honestly, i don't care what people do in the privacy of their own homes, within reason. if two men want to practice homosexuality in private, then that's their concern. but i object to the normalisation of homosexuality because i think that it's a revolting tendency which should not be considered normal or healthy, nor should it form a part of accepted society. i despise transsexualism because it is clearly a form of mental illness, and accepting it enables it.

Neutral	capitalism is a term invented by people like marx that we just accept as being the opposite of socialist theory.      "capitalism", in meaning free markets and free exchange of goods and labor, is the default status of human beings. it is literally the economics of human nature. it needs no government intervention to operate it's core mechanisms, only to restrain it.      by comparison, socialism cannot operate without government intervention at even the most rudimentary level.

[URL]      - he polls better among minorities than he does among the whites.       - his foreign affairs look great to me. you haven't said much that i can respond to, but he's against excessive military force and the war on terror. if he applies the same morality to international affairs that he applies to internal, i feel like he's definitely in good shape. the campaigning candidate is different from the elected candidate but hopefully we'll see.       - he has a better grasp on economics than the majority of politicians that i've observed. gutting the working class to subsidize the rich is never going to work but until he started stirring up shit, it seemed like almost all democratic politicians were right on board for that. glad that's changing.       - as far as being an easy opponent do destroy, he's the democratic frontrunner with lots of grassroots support. hillary wasn't able to completely wipe him out even after getting the nomination. it's not 2020 yet, but enthusiasm for him has remained pretty stable since 2016. grassroots support was one of the keys to obama's success and the democratic party itself has adjusted its metrics for candidate eligibility to include that, so he's ticking a lot of the right boxes for that party overall.

Neutral	this hit deep. i'm working on disability. my wife is disabled and something's suddenly wrong with her spine near her legs. looking like a narrowing of the canal.      i'm terrified. but i'm not going to leave her. i just wish i could do more to relieve the pain. it'll get better, in the sense that we'll get through it. we've been through all kinds of scares by now.
Neutral	1. don't let anyone's opinions get to you because they don't know you like you know yourself.       2. i used to be like you, i used to get such extreme anxiety at school i would count my steps and avoid talking to others. if i had to i think i would always feel like some sort of chest pain that makes me want to cry and shit. it sucked, everyday of school last year and the beginning of this years school year was terrible. i was very very good at placing myself in last place. when i'd be with a friend group i would be there just to feel comfortable and all that. there's so much more i wish i could explain but someone knows my account smh. anyways, all you need to know is that change starts when you start loving yourself again. throw everything you heard about yourself away and start to think positively about yourself. even if it's just looking at a mirror and thinking "yea i'm good looking" or anything that's up bringing do that, it may feel super weird and so promise it's gonna b me weird for a while cuz it still is for me and all that but it does change. i'm a completely different person from what i was around 4 months ago. i have confidence now and it's amazing. i can walk up to people and actually talk. every change starts with yourself. it may be cringe in the beginning to compliment yourself but doing this is something amazing that everyone feeling low should acquire. i hope the best for you because it is not easy to do this and it does take some gut but i know that you, random stranger on the web can definitely do this because it is possible. goodluck

Neutral	yeah, you can see by my all caps usage, and my calls for action to do boycott the company, that i was engaging in classic internet outrage.      anyone who just flat out believes all reports is an ass and most people i know don't just blindly believe every claim they hear.      i'm black(well, half black) and have experienced racism more times than i can count. every black family member i know has just as many or more stories of racism. i have seen it happen to many of my friends. by peers, by teachers, by police, by other parents.             i actually speak out against hate crime hoaxes and despise people who use the race card whenever it suits them.              but i firmly believe that there are vastly more acts of racism than false claims. the false claims are naturally going to be louder because the people making them have the singular goal of making their claim heard and getting something out of it.

Neutral	thank you for your comment. it's amusing but admittedly disheartening when i posted a hardly controversial observation and asked for others input and i get downvoted. nothing new really.       but yes, absolutely correct. i disagree as i believe scientific/ technological advancement is always 20 if not 50 years ahead. however, even in vegas they have several restaurants that utilize an automated sanding machine to serve alcohol. it's even been said that in 10 years, most manual labor jobs will have a more efficient robotic counterpart...      there are seriously grave consequences and the ever increasing role of a.i./ automation must be taken into consideration rather than mere apathy or joking reference...
Neutral	in reality u/areeb07 is a r/bakchodi sleeper agent. years of trying to talk some sense into our brothers (and sisters)  over at randia has had no effect. the only way to truly bakchod a backchod is by letting go of your earthly desires and being fully committed to the mission. this guy mentioned how his friend's joke about him being a raw agent, when the reality is that he's from an elite group of highly skilled individuals that surpasses even the mossad and cia.

Neutral	there are two kinds of hard -        ahem, let me rephrase that.       there are two different reasons that getting into a course is difficult - required results (med school) and limited places.       to get into law school here in the uk, as far as i know, you basically have to have a first in a law undergraduate degree.       to get into royal academy of dramatic arts you need to shine at your audition- thousands apply for a small number of places.       the trick is to realise this is basically the same reason

Neutral	um, so i watched a documentary about general tso's chicken like 3 years ago and it mentioned how most chinese food in the u.s. is americanized including fortune cookies and general tso's chicken. so where is the cultural appropriation, and where is the "gathering point for local chinese people" in a restaurant industry that was adapted by chinese people to be more likable for a wider range of people.

Neutral	what's funny is good science fiction writers( orwell, issamov)  follow almost the exact same process as the military threat assessment and planning divisions. they look at situations and think of likely outcomes based on evidence, logic and projective thinking. every version of those assesments comes to the same conclusions, autonomous ai with military capabilities will end in a horrific fashion, and not only do these chuckleheads ignore these assessments but they ironically name their shit after those same dire warnings. tom clancy wrote about a 911 scenario 10 to 15 years before it actually happened but these guys are just " fiction writers". they always say they will be controlled by humans but they are already saying the " wingman" will fire before the human can have time to react, that doesn't sound like complete control to me.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	leftoids and chapos are worse than mdefaggots.      too many comments here seething when they see a rightoid take, instead of applying proper bantz like a real dramatard.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	and, of course: look at the media crucifixions recently... full coverage for smiling at a native dude?! (smirking is a form of violence, obviously.) and jussie smolett gets let off the hook? and the far-left (fascist. they're fascists. it's a code word so we don't say a word associated with horrible atrocities. george soros said that himself.) news sources, jezebel/young turks/woke internet culture, cnn "news," and countless youtube propaganda channels: are blatantly anti-man. and one thing you might not know: is that they very well might try to make those hate crime laws federal to affect all males nationwide. so we need to be ready for that if it comes to that.      ​      -controlled mass media: ^ those sources i just mentioned, say the soros funded propaganda sources like: buzzfeed "news", contrapoints, young turks type youtube channels & cnn "news," are the biggest "news" sources in the country mostly. i put quotes around "news" because nowadays? there is no line between news and propaganda these days. this is insanely fascist, to a terrifying degree. and a "professional news network" like cnn, with the help of cultural marxists shifting the culture in a direction where propaganda and blatant lies are accepted as facts, is able to literally spew revised history, fake science, fake studies, cite propagandists, insist that cultural marxists's lies aren't lies, knowing damn well they are. (obviously.)      ​      -obsession with white supremacy: all white people are racist!!! lol, but seriously... we are terrified beyond rationality, because of the far left propagandists telling you that white people are responsible for all things wrong in the world and throughout history. and people become so brainwashed that you're fine with them being falsely accused and losing their jobs if it's "going to keep you safe and not hurt any feelings!"      ​      also worth mentioning: they don't care about the stories of thousands of false rape accusations, made up hate crimes that result in innocent people suffering abuse and torture in rooms without cameras, and mass overuse of solitary confinement, which psychologists correctly deemed "torture." and "inhumane."      ​      no, they're more concerned with smashing the gender binary: "gender-fluid" you know, our correct choice of words that biologists and academics stand behind... but they hate intellectuals, and don't care about what the academic community thinks. (we'll get into that in a bit.) black males are a perfect example of the rise of fascism in america: blacks, males especially, commit i think the highest amount of crime in the country. and hmm, i wonder why? maybe because even when a gay black male wastes police resources on an elaborate hoax... well... let's just say it was a very revealing moment in history.      -religion and universities intertwined: the changing of the meaning of words are a thing because "equality." by the way, rocks and pebbles are microaggressions. oh, you disagree with me? well "academics" at this super lefty university said they are. can you prove that academics didn't tell me that?      ​      this is how fascists talk. it's all part of a game they play. always look out for this tactic. make sure you keep them talking about the facts and data. they never have any. ever. they only know how to manipulate and play mind games and construct arguments they can't lose. and then, what they try to do is piss you off so you act up and get angry, and then it gives the appearance to dumbasses and progressives that you "lost the argument" or "got banned lol." never give them the satisfaction.      ​      hammer them down on data and facts. don't let them pivot. don't let them argue in "moral territory," because that's entirely "subjective." moral could mean anything, and fascists call anything they don't like "immoral." for instance: "immigration policy." the thing that saves tens of billions of dollars a year and helps millions of people, is "immoral." just keep it in "objective territory." don't budge. don't show emotion. just expose to everybody that they have nothing to back up their arguments but feelings. prove that all they do is argue from feelings. not "facts" and "logic!"      ​      but yeah: "women are oppressed in america more than other countries," and "it's impossible for black people to be racist," "gender is a spectrum!" etc. you can literally pretend social science is telling you anything. "culture wars" have been the most gruesome in existence. they think "social science" told us that women are oppressed. you say "no, they're not..." then they say:"can you prove that?!" and the "social science" card effectively shuts down all rational political discourse. and they could repeat that for an hour, and people in this country won't even think that's irrational and moronic at this point.      ​

Neutral	i don't know which captain marvel movie they've watched but the one i did had two positive main male characters and another great male supporting characters. carol went through air force training in the 80's, so yeah, she faced sexism. that's not surprising.       that being said, saying that someone saying that the movie is teaching girls to hate men only makes them hate men is wrong and shouldn't be tolerated. i'm going to exaggerate here, but it's similar to saying that violently protesting against racism will only make people more racist. even though violent protests aren't okay (maybe in the most extreme cases), that doesn't mean they justify racism
Neutral	i think dany is certainly a bit mad. there are flashes of it, in both the books and the show. my guess in the books is that she'll have become more brutal when she returns from her little dragon side-quest (seems to have embraced 'fire and blood').       in the show, it certainly tries to portray her burning of the tarlys as being somewhat unhinged.      she's not nearly as mad as her brother and father, but there's still something there.

Neutral	steemit is promising but also a ghost town now. functionality wise it's pretty cool though, like reddit but more like a blog site, so you can have pictures and video in your post (think instead of image and self post it's the two combined kind of like a html document).      it's run on a cryptocurrency where the upvotes and karma actually add up to a payout. naturally it is now 99% bot abuse and karma farming and the shittest shitposts you've ever seen, 1% actual users posting legitimately cool art stuff and of course circlejerking over this week's popular shitcoin.      the big draw of it, that is both also a huge disadvantage, is that no one can physically delete anything. it can be downvoted ("flagged") into oblivion and the frontend can be set up to expunge stuff below a score though, and there is no one there to intervene when someone does that. so that makes for a kind of shit culture where people are scared to upset the power users who can drop a -10 dollar flag on your post, or make a bot that auto flags everything. the idea of it is though that it's a monetisation model where the act of voting does a blockchain thing that makes more of that coin, and you get money from it (and the voter gets some as well called curation). in theory yeah that's great, in practice you need literally millions of upvotes from small steem power accounts to amount to anything, and there is nothing stopping some bully from running an account that does nothing but auto flag all submissions by someone.      but as far as hosting something up there goes it works super well at least lol. and if it were actually populated with a broad userbase it would counteract the problems i mentioned above. to some extent, because you can never really stop someone with power from abusing it.

PersonDirectedAbuse$Slur	here's my pasta on sargon. share it far and wide:      #carl benjamin, aka sargon of akkad      ##racism      > in two videos — one of which has since been deleted by youtube audio here— benjamin repeatedly used the n-word. he said a youtuber and the alt-right were "faggots" and "acting like n*ggers" in showing him disrespect because "white people are supposed to be polite. you act....exactly like you describe black people acting".       and no, it's not okay to use the n-word as an insult just because you're talking to racists. that 'context' doesn't make this okay. he wasn't talking to them on 'their level.' he was being a racist.       ##anti-semitism      > "i'm sorry about the holocaust, but i don't give a shit."      ##more racism      > "but over halfway into the two-hour video, benjamin seemed to lose his patience for the discussion. he repeatedly resorted to calling catlin the n-word for not being able to have a civilised conversation."      > ""why would you begin our conversation like that?" benjamin said, pausing the video. "it kind of makes me think you want the internet to open up with a big bunch of memes on your ass calling you a n*gger. it's not personal — no one really thinks you're a n*gger.""      ##paedophilia      > "in 2017, benjamin interviewed a singaporean blogger called amos yee for his podcast, the thinkery podcast, where the two discussed scrapping the age of consent for sex. during the interview, yee argued it "should be fine" and "completely reasonable" for adults to have sex with 13- or 14-year-olds.      > "it's controversial because people have a kind of mental block in their minds when they talk about this," benjamin said. "because in, i think probably this country, we're in america at the moment and in britain the age of consent is 16. if you were to say something like, 'well, i think it should be reduced to 14,' that sounds like a hugely controversial opinion, that sounds like you want adults to prey on children."      > "it's actually not as controversial as you think," benjamin said. "for example, i think in the netherlands the age of consent is something like 12 or 14. it's actually surprisingly young to western, you know, english-speaking sensibilities. but across the european continent its a lot lower than you would think."      source      ##more paedophilia      "(the age of consent) depends on the child, doesn't it"      and the rest of the conversation for context (it's even worse fucking somehow):      "i can tell you i think one of the reasons that the adults i was screwing around with liked me is because their dick looked so much bigger in my little hands." and then goes onto talk about "eddie", the guy he was "dating" at the time. i'm not even going to go into where it goes from there as sargon laughs hysterically and joins in, because frankly i don't want to type out explicit descriptions of adults having sex with 10-year-olds."source      "i can be quoted as saying you can **** young boys. it's not as controversial as you think. depends on the child, doesn't it? the ancient greeks considered it to be normal, it was mentoring." source      ##rape 'jokes'      ukip mep parliament candidate carl benjamin says he 'might' rape labour mp jess phillips      "there's been an awful lot of talk about whether i would or wouldn't rape jess phillips. i suppose with enough pressure i might cave, but let's be honest nobody's got that much beer."         ##making excuses for conservative terrorists      like the killer elliot rogers:       >"before your stupid social justice feminine bullshit (mass-murder) didn't happen on this scale...you are responsible for perpetuating it by disenfranchising these poor fucking (mass murderers) who don't have any options left...it is a fucking feminist system that's doing this." source.      carl has also spread misinformation in defence of other conservative killers - like james alex fields who was convicted of murdering  anti-fascist protestor heather heyer. what did carl have to say:      >"it's more that the alt-right are being blamed for someone having a heart attack, someone in tremendously bad physical condition has a heart attack and suddenly the alt-right has murdered someone. source      ##misc      * carl also refers to bernie sanders as a communist. it's always telling when a 'rational centrist' considers a social democrat a fucking communist.      * carl invited supporters to a gaming community that has chatrooms filled with white supremacist and anti-semitic content      ##on sexual assault      >"anyone who takes to twitter to make a sexual assault allegation is lying. you make an allegation like that to the police"      but also, carl benjamin on tv:      >"i have been sexually assaulted". "my wife has been raped."      source

Neutral	this is just scratching the surface.
Neutral	i'm actually rather shocked the mods deleted that. typically they'l leave up anything they agree with even if it breaks the subs rules. a few weeks ago they left up a direct link to the gofundme of the employee that spit on eric trump despite it being very against sub rules. they only took it down many hours later and only after another article was posted proving that the gofundme was fake and after people there had donated to it.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	people who think you don't need dysphoria to be trans. sane people call them transtrenders.
Neutral	the ill aren't scary, psychiatric hospitals are, the practices that went down in said places through history were deplorable and horrifying, hence why they are set in said areas, you were more likely to go insane in one than you were to leave with your sanity still intact, which is why it is used often in horror, not because "huuu, scary insane people..."
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i read an article very recently about how men are dying as a result of fentanyl at a rate three times that of women, where just a few years ago the rates were similar. it made me think "this is what men's rights people should be concerned about! look at this terrible drug epidemic that is disproportionately affecting men!"       but since it doesn't involve shitting on women, who cares.      link: [URL]

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	what i always find incredibly interesting / telling about that situation is that maybe two weeks earlier a crazy leftist mailed white powder to members of trump's family, government officials, and conservative politicians.        almost the exact same fucking thing the fake bomb idiot did.        (real anthrax arguably could be more dangerous than real mail bombs.)      but most people have probably never even heard about that.         meanwhile fake bomb idiot got major coverage and to this day is still used as an excuse by the left.

Neutral	they put out a documentary about him called "anonymous" which is a complete fraud starting with the title.
Neutral	i do agree, but even if it's 1% of cops that are bad, that means 1 bad cop in a town with 100 cops, and 100 bad cops in a city with 10,000 cops.  can you point to 100 bad cops in chicago?  it will always be a problem we have to keep an eye out for, unless you neuter the police force to the point that they are ineffective.  chicago does appear to have more corruption than other cities, but it's also quite possible they're just really shitty at cover ups.  reporting on police misbehavior drives clicks, reporting on police *good* behavior does not, so whatever you see on the news is always going to give a much more bleak view of the police than actual statistics will, even if there is variance between cities in terms of the percentage of police interactions that go poorly, which there *always* will be.  this is one area where 'equality of outcome' will never happen, no matter how hard you try.
Neutral	would most libertarians be in favor of enforcing anti-trust legislation on twitter and facebook (maybe reddit too)?      or government regulation of them as the dominant public online forums?      i lean right in today's political environment, but i am 100% in favor of the former

Neutral	and have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, i say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. i knew that sound well, too. it was the beating of the old man's heart. it increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.      but even yet i refrained and kept still. i scarcely breathed. i held the lantern motionless. i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray upon the litter bit fat doozi. meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. it grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. the other laowai's terror must have been extreme! it grew louder, i say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well i have told you that i am nervous: so i am. and now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. yet, for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still. but the beating grew louder, louder! i thought the heart must burst. and now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! the other laowai's xiaoshi had come! with a loud yell, i threw open the coolpad flashlight and leaped into the room. he shrieked once --once only. in an instant i dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. i then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. but, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. this, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. at length it ceased. the laowai was dead. i removed the bed and examined the corpse. yes, he was stone, stone dead. i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. there was no pulsation. he was stone dead. his eve would trouble me no more.      if still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body. the night waned, and i worked hastily, but in silence. first of all i dismembered the corpse. i cut off the head and the arms and the legs.      i then carefully an meticulously put each of the pieces inside the empty chamion pizza dlivery boxes littering the floor.      when i had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight. as the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. i went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had i now to fear? there entered three jingcha shooshoo, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity.. an elderly neighbor, a former red guard, who was faemers in the neighborhood for throwing eggs at monks and smashing a yuan dynasty buddha carving had reported that a laowai lived next to them, and that the police should see if they are spies.      i smiled, --for what had i to fear? i bade the gentlemen welcome. the shriek, i said, was my own in a dream. the laowai, i mentioned, hway low jyah luh. i took my visitors all over the house. i bade them search --search well. i led them, at length, to his chamber. i showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. in the enthusiasm of my confidence, i brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while i myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, put a maidanglow bag on top of the pizza boxes and nongfu quan bottles filled with my urine.      the officers were satisfied. my manner had convinced them. i was singularly at ease. they sat, and while i answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. but, ere long, i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. my head ached, and i fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. the ringing became more distinct: --it continued and became more distinct: i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, i found that the noise was not within my ears.      no doubt i now grew very pale; --but i talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. yet the sound increased --and what could i do? it was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. i gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. i talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. i arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. why would they not be gone? i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. oh god! what could i do? i foamed --i raved --i swore! i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. it grew louder --louder --louder! and still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. was it possible they heard not? almighty god! --no, no! they heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!-this i thought, and this i think. but anything was better than this agony! anything was more tolerable than this derision! i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! i felt that i must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!      "villains!" i shrieked, "dissemble no more! i admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --it is the beating of his hideous heart!"      -the end-

IdentityDirectedAbuse	even if we didn't read the response...              it always blows my mind when people talk about "men are so fragile that they had to completely lord over females for all of recorded history."      if this were the case why didn't the clearly superior (or even equal) women stop them at some point?
Neutral	growing down. he's growing down.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	be the transition you want to xe.
Neutral	technically you can be arrested but according to the article:   > though the union acknowledged it is against metro rules to eat on a train or in a station, hobson's statement also referenced an email from metro transit police chief ron pavlik sent may 8, ordering officers to "cease and desist from issuing criminal citations in the district of columbia for fare evasion; eating; drinking; spitting, and playing musical instruments without headphones until further advised."      > "understanding this email, our operator clearly was doing no wrong," the union statement said.      so while it's true it's something so minor there's actual cease and desist orders placed on following it through.

Neutral	in a republic you have a sovereign, usually it's the president of that nation. i think you mean absolute sovereign. although i think absolute monarchy is a bit of a misnomer, usually these monarchies had like a thousand bizarre ancient rituals and medieval traditions that restricted their power. the more absolutist monarchs pushed back against these, but even the most extreme pretty much never established a situation where their will was unquestionable and always respected law. at best they made pretensions of such while usually being ignored.
Neutral	12 hour shifts, most likely.
Neutral	i don't think they were saying it counts against that reasoning, just that power dynamics are only inherent to incestual relationships with generational gaps/age differences. i don't fully agree, but their point that there's no real way to ~rationally~ pinpoint why incest is inherently immoral is a valid one.

Neutral	horse hockey. i live in texas, grew up in south texas. had a husky/spitz mix that did just fine in the heat. and my shepherd does fine in the heat as long as he has shade and water.
Neutral	u/elainepaige123 so i had started talking to this guy about five months ago, that liked me back in high school. im now 20 and he's 21. it started out as texting and then we started hanging out. at first i had made it clear that i only wanted to be friends. i really liked him, but my christian parents did not allow me to date him, because he is an atheist. i am completely undecided as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out, but at the time i was just going to school and was completely dependent on my parents financially and had to follow their rules.      my parents allowed me to hang out with him as long as nothing more happened, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so i called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than i was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly, but mostly because my mother found out and didn't allow me to contact him anymore. i sent him a message and explained everything about my parents and how i wasn't allowed to see him. he texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again secretly over text messages. before long i am sneaking out and going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job.      he said that he wanted to help me get out of my parents house, as they are extremely controlling and he hated them for it. he was in the process of getting a new job and said when he got his first paycheck we'd get an apartment together, as i was also starting a new job. he was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that he didn't want to lose me. he also said that i was his best friend, which is when i fell hard, because i've never had a best friend. eventually i was sending nudes, as we rarely got to see each other and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere.      he got the job that he had been wanting and we were so happy. the next day i lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says i'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. he told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. he also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better.      i asked for a better explanation, but he said, " listen to me! you can just be a friend i'm at work now!" later i told him that i had to block him and wouldn't be able to speak to him again and he said, "alrighty.". i asked him why he was being so cold and he said it wasn't cool of me to block him. i explained it was because of my parents and he said he was sorry and that he understood.      that's the last i heard from him. did he ever love me or did i just get played? is it possible that he faked a whole 5 month relationship? could he have lied about everything he said about me?      or was he for real about his reasons? it was all so sudden and he hasn't spoken to me since, as my parents found out that i was sneaking out and forced me to block him and put a tracker app on my phone so that they know everywhere that i go. i'm so confused. i still love him and he said he wanted friends, but now i can't speak to home at all.      i want closure, but don't know how to get it. i was honestly turning into a nervous wreck, because of the situation with my parents. all of the lies and lack of freedoms was getting to me and i wasn't okay. he kept telling me i looked "devastated" the last time i saw him. i was not mentally well, because i felt like i was morally wrong. i used to send him long messages every so often explaining my emotions and then regret it later, but he said he was okay with it. i wonder if that is why he left. i feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as i am usually a shy person.      tl;dr guy that i fell in love with says he loves me, then dumps me after taking my virginity. haven't heard from him since.
Neutral	removed - your headline lacks a score, as required by rule 6. feel free to resubmit.
Neutral	it's going to flip pretty hard though. remember when the religious right were in control from the 60s-90s and nobody could question them either, until comedians, musicians, atheists, new industry and the youth all started questioning and pushing back. the trend will happen the same way but on the opposite side this time.

Neutral	you're writing a response to a stranger online's thread. you aren't entitled to a response from them.      espicially if they're posting in anxiety/depression subs try to look at it through there point of view. heck when im depressed i sometimes ended up leaving messages my friends send me with out replies, so one of my last priorities would be replying to a stranger.      i'm sure you're helping other people with your responses though. perhaps the person who ignored you just isn't ready to accept that advice and is still in pity party mode. just know that since you're posting a response publicly it has the potential to help anyone who comes across that thread who feels similarly. try not to focus too much on the fact that you wrote a reply therefore you are owed a reply because that is just not true.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i like how you *post* to rightwing hate subs, but *diatribe* to left-leaning subs      everything the leftist nuts on reddit do is colored by deception and being intentionally misleading lol      ~~politicalleaningbot is just an asbolute lazy dumpsterfire banged out by a script kiddie from r/politics~~, haha, nevermind, it's not even a bot. jesus that's even weirder.      userleansbot on the other hand seems to actually just anaylize stuff and make one of a few bad jokes, at a glance anyways. it's still very incomplete data though, but at least it isn't just used to stalk people suspected of the crime of being right-wing, telling them they're hateful
Neutral	i opened the window and a breeze rolled in and i **jizzed, in my pants**.
Neutral	your opinion of what is dangerous is not sufficient justification for removing another person's ability to view direct sources.  direct sources are by nature a fact of reality.  erasing them is akin to an attempt to remove reality.  only dictators and propagandists 'need' to remove reality.

Neutral	me and my sister live with my dad and despite being from a lower income family, my dad always buys my sister anything she wants. he makes sure she can have anything she ever asks for, and does it as quick as possible. but with me, it's a completely different story. i literally got nothing for my 18th birthday,  but my sister gets concert tickets once a month. my sister is doted on, but with me, i'm constantly ridiculed and criticized and literally physically abused. my dad kicked me in the fucking chin today for having a different opinion than him. the worst part is my sister literally doesn't apply herself whatsoever and exhibits little to no empathy, especially for all the pets my dad lets her have. on the other hand, i work hard, pay for my own car, i'm graduating with a 4.0 gpa, and i got into one of the best schools in the country, and all my dad can do is belittle me.  it honestly makes me feel worthless
Neutral	watched this video it's fucking great...

Neutral	>i think the fact that we had a civil war, and 50% of american voters voted in an open white nationalist, and (insert all the structural racism in the usa, wealth inequality, countless instances of direct racial bias and bigotry, etc), the idea that a confederate american state could rise and participate in global affairs isn't far fetched for an alternate history game that wants real ideological / economic threads to inform the events in the game.   the problematic part is not the inclusion of a revived, politically significant, openly racist and fascist (sorry to anyone who don't know this, but the rise of so-called "populism" you see on the right is a rise of fascism, read a book) confederacy in ww2, but rather the prospect of individual players identifying with the confederacy and what such play indicates and consists in. is it okay to role play as lynching thugs?   it's a deep question, honestly. contextualized properly, one can do interesting things with it. other art forms employ genuine antiheroes (like tony soprano, who is, simply, a psychopath) and do good things (criticize capitalism, and the emotional/intellectual dissociation involved with immoral behavior both localized and structural/systemic). what does "i'm the character" do to change it? in a book, we're often in the person's mind. their thoughts replace ours in a focused narrative. is that alright? will i become a psychopath if i read such media?   i don't know. i think it merits discussion, but the statement the guy made sounds fine to me. are they cashing in on the rise of the alt-right and open white supremacy in america? i don't know. do we want to allow role playing games and alternate reality media? that one, i'm pretty comfortable with yes. we need to do deeper, broader, better things to eliminate white supremacists than make sure they can't role play as the confederacy joining ww2.      this mad about a video game

Neutral	i used to believe everything, and i thought i was crazy for thinking otherwise or thinking my mom is crazy, but now my boyfriend believes she's crazy too.       i was adopted and placed outside pretty much immediately after birth, and i'm generally kind of a cold person.       so my mom wants to have our family friend do a soul retrieval on me to get back any part of my soul that went missing when i was put outside. like. what.       she says she can't aait until my sister and i go off to college so she can travel. i mean, good on you, but maybe you shouldn't have had kids in the first place.       i don't know, i used to think maybe i was the bad child and a bad person for questioning whether my mom was right or wrong. but now i've started telling people what happens and asking if i'm crazy or if it's actually something weird. usually they agree that its a bit odd or crazy.

Neutral	>it suggests gender identity is for outsiders to decide.      last time i checked, the whole concept of 'gender' was based on societal expectations in the first place.      >it medicalizes the experience of being transgender.      no, being transgender is a mental issue. it's already medical, you're trying to de-medicalize it and act like your definition is the 'real' one.      >it's a eurocentric definition of transgender.      yes, because trend-jumping western teens on tumblr who want attention have a right to use the """""""transgender""""""" definitions of some tribe in tanzania or wherever. don't y'all call that sort of thing "cultural appropriation"?      >it equates being trans with distress and dysfunction.      this is literally just repeating the thesis statement.      >it tells people they aren't trans enough.      yes, when "enough" means "at all". you want to turn transgenderism into some sort of sliding scale,  probably because people laugh at "non-binary".      >it breeds transphobia.      that's like saying rachel dolezal breeds racism against black people.

Neutral	when i was in the fourth grade my mom homeschooled me.      or, in reality, she enslaved me and my siblings. my sister was her eldest, her precious artist, and my brother was her little angel, her precious baby and only boy.      she had two hands for two kids and i didn't fit in. she constantly put me down and physically beat me. once hitting me in the head with a frying pan because i didnt do the dishes right.      i got away from her finally, and for my graduation project i decided to do something based around child abuse         because of that emotional abuse that i went through, i thought less of my self and had a thin skin, always crying. and everyone called me sensitive, a crybaby, the little piggy who cried all the way home.          but i'm here to tell you that you're not alone. there are thousands of surveys and information online, and i think you need to start educating others because you're not sensitive, you're hurt and you need help, like i needed help. it can be different for you but you need people who support you. it hurts to think people are so cruel, but i was at the brunt end of it for a while, so i want you to know i'm here for you.      message me at any time, ask me questions, vent or rant to me. because, no, i may not have gone through the exact same thing, but i went through something close.      i hope you consider talking to me. it's always better to start off ranting online when you can hide behind a screen and let your emotions take over. i want your emotions to be valid, because everyone deserves to feel validated.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	secularism in its original form means separation of religion and state. it basically means that the state should not interfere in religious matter and religion should not interfere in state matters.    all religions should respect the laws no matter what. for example if using loudspeakers is considered a public offence, then you should be prosecuted for it, even if its just following your religious beliefs.       things like separate marriage code for muslims, hajj subsidy by the government, as well as hinduphobia and embracing and catering muslims because they're a "minority under threat" by the leftist "liberals" and other bullshit spoon-feeding done to muslims is in itself against the very concept of secularism that these  stupid "progressive liberals" claim to be standing for.

Neutral	i just don't feel like the lgbt group is a catch all for everyone who doesn't fit the norm. i'm heterosexual and polyamorous, it's definitely not the way most normal people live their lives, but i don't consider myself to be lgbt just because my sex life isn't the same as the average person.
Neutral	i did read it, which i why i quoted it. here's the full quote:      >and i thought the query about whether or not i was asking about animal experimentation was glib. the implication was clear: those who experimented on animals – 'animal work' – knew this form of research was **completely unreliable** – 'limited' – but continued to inflict suffering and death on an industrial scale **for nothing anyway.**
Neutral	yeah, um, thanks for the silver dude but i'm not going to worship you.
Neutral	oops, probably why they had to cut the resolution on this fake video on their second run through.      probably lots of editing in this video as well covered up by low resolution.      we can make chris evans looks realistically skinny in high definition a few years ago and there's not even blood or damage from anything or anybody who's shooting at.      reminds of of test footage they'd release before transformers and ironman came out where they had a laptop with built in rockets float and it was supposed to be something to prevent it from falling and the video was shaky and low quality (most likely test footage for the ironman move as it was released shortly before and matches the style of him working in his home).      calling it a "livestream" was simply the excuse for having the video so low quality as i've never seen a live stream as low quality as this by even the poorest of people, let alone a guy who can afford all these weapons and ammunition.      there is absolutely no doubt this is fake and there definitely was a mag in there before he entered the building.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	why are radfems so hell bent on making women miserable and unable to enjoy sex?       i suspect it's because millett and dworkin, and most of the original now gang were crazy, spiteful, and quite frankly, ugly bitches who were sour grapesing their own situations, but there are some actually attractive radfems out there who could actually attract a man who doesn't have a mental illness. but for some reason they continue to preach an almost puritanical hatred of sex and personal enjoyment/fulfillment.       it's like they are some bizarro world counterpart to graham and kellogg.

Neutral	they're not banned because they're *not* requesting to speak to a child. you're completely unfamiliar with the lingo and the fetish. the term *little* does not refer to an actual, literal child. a little is an *adult* woman (or man, i guess) who adopts the childish role in a ddlg relationship.

Neutral	i don't disagree with a thing you've said.       except maybe with the last paragraph    > women are taught to show emotion and are shamed for it, men are taught to not show emotion and get rewarded for it. yes it is at the cost of their own mental health and that is what the toxic form of masculinity is, but it doesn't mean women have much better.      when it comes to big picture, yes, you're right. however i think in the day to day of society woman who shows emotion isn't shunned for it like a man is.       i 100% agree that it is all up worse to be a woman (still wish i was one though) but i think where it comes to this specific thing, women are lucky.
Neutral	for the most part i try not to take people's inability to do basic analysis personally. like the people joking about english teachers reaching for meanings/symbols are probably in primary education themselves.      i mean english teachers usually choose books with heavy use of symbols to *teach* symbolism. most students are just too dense to get it until they are lead by the hand.       it might also explain why so many people on reddit don't get the concept of dog-whistles. the idea that words or symbols can mean more than what's written or seen is something they simply don't have the education to grasp.

Neutral	dominant group fragility, really.  i suspect that is more the point than each group characteristic of straight white cis middle class men.        the current state of the culture wars is there is an increasing portion of each dominant group that has moved on from just denying their privilege and dominance.  they now actively turn the tables, claiming victimhood at the hands of minorities.     this is an inseparable mix of disingenuous and deeply felt.   there were always insignificant cranks who did that but now it is a grievance industry and a rapidly growing global political force sweeping the west.           speaking as something of a feminist it drives me nuts that feminism does not seem to have any ideas about how to operate in the new environment, or to acknowledge its own part in creating it, or that a lot of feminism is now the establishment.

PersonDirectedAbuse	doesn't he have even more than clinton? like, clinton had a cordial relationship with epstein, but trump was legit chummy with the guy. he went on record repeatedly calling him and upstanding fellow, repeatedly went to his house parties where we now know pedo shit was going down, repeatedly used epstein's pedo express...      this is one of those things where i would be amazed if trump didn't *at least* know about epstein's disgusting behavior and do nothing about it. their closeness and trump's presence at all the places epstein did his shit when the shit was going down makes the idea that trump is totally innocent of anything epstein related completely ludicrous. he must have at least *known*.      it's truly incredibly to watch the ddf go on about how clinton needs to be locked up/investigated for being friends with epstein (and let's be real, he probably should be, because he also almost certainly at least knew and did nothing), but immediately call you a troll if you say "yeah but trump literally did all the same stuff clinton did and more! shouldn't he get investigated, too?"

Neutral	you responded before i finished my edit about power imbalances.  i imagine they definitely come hand in hand with a lot of incestuous relationships, but like, power imbalances are a thing in *a ton* of non-incestuous relationships as well.  i think it's hard to say that it's a problem that is particular to incest between relatives of similar ages.      > inbreeding is more harmful as a practice than the individual instances.      i think that's fair, but that seems like more of a pragmatic argument to put prohibitions on it than a moral argument against its practice.  it seems to me like at the end of the day the issue is still that by having sex two relatives increase the risk of health problems in future generations.  this effect is compounded by successive generations of incest in a way that could be *especially* harmful, but idk it seems to me like if you're going to argue that incest on the whole is immoral that need to apply to individual instances and not just multigenerational practices.      > though on a related note: this movie is hilariously bad.      can you imagine what it must have felt like to be gary oldman, standing on your knees while getting ready to do a scene with peter dinklage?  like, just cast peter dinklage as the lead, his french accent is pitiful anyways!

Neutral	ahahahahahahaha! ahahahahaha! i spit out my coffee. lmfao.           hahaha.. you're right though. not all of them. just the richest ones. i mean, look at the dude who was in black beach prison in equatorial guinea when he got caught with his british mercenary team of commandos to try to stage a coup there for people like margaret thatcher's son and other world billionaires and corporate elite. bahahahaha. they left him there to rot until he started naming off names, then they got him the fuck out of there pretty quick after a few dozen/hundred millions of shekels.          >simon francis mann is a former british army officer and mercenary. he served part of a 34-year prison sentence in equatorial guinea for his role in a failed coup d'état in 2004, before receiving a presidential pardon on humanitarian grounds on 2 november 2009.          i could go all day. hsbc bank laundery mula for the cartels, etc. law enforcement is just to keep the jails full and keep the people oppressed, but they aren't going to arrest some douche sack for flying his 10 lb's of personal cocaine to his condo overseas on his private jet - well he might get a slap on the wrist, but you or i would be looking at life. the top banks and businesses are all above the law, to think otherwise is hilarious. maybe some shit hole country would try to enforce their law on someone to get publicity to their shithole country but it would be shortlived, and would just be more publicity for said rich person that they could write a book about and make millions more.          i have nothing against rich people. i'm from an upper middle class family and i've lived poor on my own for a long time and it sucks. people want to blame capitalism or socialism or whatever, but it all boils down to people. people are fucked and the most savage animals on the planet, because they have the ability to come off as genuine and can fake being your friend, or entire careers and/or relationships and then eat your heart out while you're sleeping.
Neutral	i'm in a similar place as a father raising two little girls. it's amazing how people justify their actions, place their guilt and seemingly move on with their lives.. but you're right,those decisions will be with them forever.
Neutral	what in the fuck even is 10000dchess? i just went there to see what it is and i can't tell if they're being ironic and making fun of the shit they're posting, or if they actually believe it, or...       someone care to help my dense ass out?

Neutral	so can we arrest black people for shootings without evidence, then?
IdentityDirectedAbuse	what's the difference? it's still nigger tho.
Neutral	i think you misunderstood my post. i am saying that a lot of non-black people would not want to put themselves in situations where they could be mistaken or accused of racism and instead decide to just not interact and build relationships with black people.
Neutral	can you name even 2 right wing people on mainstream tv?
Neutral	oh, shit.
Neutral	lol this is what you look like
Neutral	it's been logging me out randomly now too? my page will flash and load new reddit and then i have to log back in to get back to old. it's disgusting and blatantly obvious they are trying a bunch of gross little tactics to get people to swap by annoying .old users.      anything to get those adviews.

Neutral	damn... this answer sounds like it came from experience rather than a textbook. i hope what ever happen to you that your okay as well op.
Neutral	i think that reddit will go eventually. they pretty much just catalyzed their own doom over the past few years. there's nothing wrong with wanting to change your business model to be more profitable but they shunned their original users.      they built their platform based off "stop internet censorship!" (i still have the stickers they gave out years ago). now the content is really, really shallow. anything that goes against the grain is [removed]. i came to see a high amount of censorship on the site in almost every subreddit; especially the default ones. every time they would say the person broke some generic rule that can be interpreted in any way a mod wants.      for me i started noticing the cancer when they changed the default subreddits.
Neutral	thanks. i get it. i've had my own battles with mental health stuff, especially anxiety. i guess everyone is different. i always jumped at the chance to talk to someone who had gone through something similar. but i can totally see how responding could be overwhelming for some people who are struggling.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	actors are retarded

Neutral	weird bc it was made before the elite and it was teh elite who mass murdered christians and jews.
Neutral	> this comment sounds like it was made by a bitter turk. "i don't care that girl i like rejected me for a date. she's an ugly whore anyway."
Neutral	ah alright l, i had no idea. i've edited my comment so i hopefully don't seem like a total moron.
Neutral	i didn't vote for trump either. i just know stupid bullshit and brainwashing when i see it!
Neutral	i agree i've been thinking this for awhile especially because of how little info is available to the general public about the region you can see something is being hidden there for sure

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	they're trying to say that pikachu is popular because it makes people who are sad and lonely feel less sad and alone, and that that's similar to how the alt-right recruits incels [and for that matter how a lot of cults recruit people] by making them feel less sad and alone.      it's a hot fucking take, but it's not actually calling pikachu a nazi.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	it's illegal to murder, some retarded people murder -> it should be illegal to be retarded      it's very basic, very short-sided logic
PersonDirectedAbuse	1rst the uss liberty was an accident they thought it was an egyptian ship. second fuck you 9/11 was obviously bush /s
Neutral	so they are segregating themselves?
Neutral	mad max without a big ass loud v8 is like the bible without jesus.
Neutral	no. we can disagree with a black persons politics without calling them a token. but when you make your game off of being " the black female conservative" you are literally tokenizing yourself.
Neutral	why? 90% of the people upvoting or even writing this shit are men.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	if she says men are trash ... she's not the one for you. or any man.       she'll end up a political lesbian anyway. until the supply dries out.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	aww, it's retarded. :::pet pet::::          i suggest you stick to finger painting and playing roblox.
Neutral	i always notice the first bit, people believing every statement or meme is a *dog whistle* for the worse possible thing they could imagine.      the second bit is all about double standards and those are always fun. r/menkampf has a field day with those.      glad to have saner heads in the game, just hope they are greater in number, too, and that the others are just a bunch of earsplitting shrills that people are forced to pay attention to out of misplaced shame.
Neutral	imagine getting smacked in the face with a summer sausage.
Neutral	lol, already at -2 karma
Neutral	it the bible it is made perfectly clear that "the evil one" is in control of our earthly realm.   the job of the evil one is to make you lose sight of your inner spirituality.   this is why the idea of god not existing is so heavily pushed.      its like this.....say you know that 9/11 is a false flag.  you dont care what shills say, they are either intentionally lying or they are ignorant to any of the facts and are just parroting what the sheep are saying.   they may think they themselves have thought of the idea but they are indeed brainwashed by propaganda.             there is an equal amount of propaganda convincing people that god does not exist.   those who dont believe insist its through their own realization that god doesnt exist, when in reality they are parroting what others have said with little if any real searching.             in this regard the evil one can act with impunity.                this is why evil is so pervasive.   1. god has allowed it, as one of the constructs of our spiritual test here and 2. ignorance of the people who think 9/11 is real is mirrored in the ignorance of those who do not believe in a higher power.             the ride has been long but it wont be much longer.  when those who are asleep think that the planned attacks are of invading "aliens from outer space" the end wont be far behind.
Neutral	truly a patrician
Neutral	i here you but the whole idea is that someone hears you and knows you are there (even if they are drunk weirdos), it's the same way people graffiti their names in places, it's a psychological way of saying "i was here" then again i am just spit balling here.
Neutral	nationalize reddit
Neutral	full of buzzwords that have led me down some amazing rabbit holes. the tibetan light body i have 3 books alone on that fascinating topic. i'd probably need a.few lifetimes just to get through it all, but yeah keep telling me it's all meaningless and none of the books are fascinating

Neutral	the thing about cheaters, is you just never know for sure.  but you never know for sure anyway.  idk man, it's your choice.  you probably are mad it just hasn't settled yet.  you will end up having to deal with resentment at some point.  i always think it  like this.  it was just me and her, now it's me her and joe jerk off.  one girl cheated on me and i couldn't get over it. i just felt like what was once mine, wasnt really mine anymore. that's just my experience though.  you guys are two different people with a different relationship and circumstances.  wish i had a solid answer to give you.
Neutral	thank you! i'll think about it. for now, i'll just keep imagining one day i'll run into him at a grocery store or something, haha. your plan sounds better though.
Neutral	i hope that people just constantly start doing this to [USER] because it's what they deserve for not doing any decent level of moderation. that sub is straight trash and those ten thousand upvotes show it. i don't understand why anyone would even want to see the content there.

Neutral	chick fila death squads?
Neutral	just as an aside, i've had, as a cyclist, drivers just straight up try to kill me.      the most obvious one was a van driver who, when we were approaching a junction, overtake me, then immediately turn the corner in front of me.       i ended up crashing into the pedestrian barrier as my least fatal option as opposed to veering directly into traffic, ramming straight into the side of the van, or breaking so hard i'd likely end up lying in the middle of a busy road.       before you ask, it was the middle of the day.       cycling in london is *exciting*
Neutral	>in the context of the world we live in now,       try to find an era in recorded  history when things were much better than today.  it's all shit.
Neutral	says the person asking for people to pm them facts.      (otters pick out a favorite rock that they carry around with them and use it to open clams.)

Neutral	frankly, i didn't get why you were a mod to begin with. no one liked your "courtship survey" posts and no one thought they were funny...
Neutral	i'm not sure which part is better, the founder showing up at josh's house to intimidate him or the compound they were building in the desert.
Neutral	i'm so sorry they said those things to you. you deserve so much better. i really think you should seriously consider some of the suggestions people have put forward. do you have somebody that you could stay with maybe?       please try to take care of yourself and protect yourself sorry but fuck your dad for saying those things and i'm sorry your mum didn't stand up for you. i hope stuff will turn around soon.       sorry

Neutral	if i've learned anything from my time traveling, people love sharing their food with people from other cultures, and they absolutely love it when other people enjoy their food.             when either my girlfriend or i are sick, we get kimchi jiggae, and last time we went, the imo running the place was super nice to us, because we told her we like that food when we're sick, and she said it reminded her of her daughter who had moved away and always misses her mother's kimchi jiggae when she is sick.             last thing these people would want is us sticking to just american food.

Neutral	this is a great theory, especially as tje treaty reads like a doctrine for world government.  however, i don't think the elites are constructing anything there.  exploring, sure.  i do believe that they're building heavily in places like the continental western united states, where there is a ton of open land.  they could have stockpiled megacities there by now, with geothermal power, water and filtration systems, and all connected by maglev trams.  it seems that china is up to that, too.  something is definitely going on in antarctica, but i think it's probably science or archaeological research.

Neutral	i don't agree with those people, but bikes can be dangerous.  usually what i see happening in nyc is people on bikes flying through red lights without checking traffics.  there's a reason why you're supposed to stop, because somebody going through the intersection doesn't expect anyone to be crossing a red light and it could cause an accident.  driver's not at fault, but it doesn't feel good to hit somebody and hurt them even when you couldn't have prevented the accident.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	did they just say their beloved abortion fanatic little angels are child abusers unless they can abort their kids? what does this say about them as people?     also, adoption is still a fucking option.

Neutral	yes, this.      there are so many ways to avoid unwanted pregnancies but i know so many women who had  unprotected sex and had abortions just because of their recklessness and not because it was medically necessary.        i never understood how my friends could be so irresponsible.  when i was poor, i was able to go to pp for a $60 exam and was prescribed a $9 birth control.  that was affordable for me and should have been affordable for my friends but... they made their choices.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	even then, it's still ultimately the weakness.      if the choice is "we'll welcome you into the fold as our attack dogs, and if you do the job well and help us take over the world, maybe i might let you have sex with me", or let the alt-right take hold of the incels and turn it to "we'll welcome you into the fold as our attack dogs, and when we put down the people who are trying to fight us and change the world to more equal ground, then we will use the power we have over these people to force them to have sex with you"...still seems like the better option to fight is the first one.
Neutral	that fucker will now stop yelling about "the plane"

Neutral	you think you're funny huh? saying 'yes' to a non 'yes or no' question? i bet you think you're really witty saying that rehased meme again. well you aren't. you aren't funny. you aren't hilarious in the slightest. i didn't laugh. i didn't grin, i didn't even exhale out of my nose. your joke wasn't funny. your joke was shit. it's stale and shitty. if you're going to make a joke, make an original one or at least improve the one you're taking. this was low effort. step up your game, or just don't make jokes in the comment section at all.
Neutral	the best way to get better is to do it! discussion groups can be helpful because you learn not just how to identify symbols or pick up on them but also when somebody may be "reaching" a bit or seeing stuff that isn't there.      i'm not particularly great either, i've just taken a lot of english courses. shakespeare is hard as hell for me to read and i can    only really understand what was going on by asking the people around me.       even if you don't want to read there are some good tv shows out there that can do symbolism well. legion on fx tells a lot of things through symbolism, it's one of my favorite shows.      if you like comics the watchmen has great symbolism and framing. as does v for vendetta. the sandman comics are good, too. i also recommend ichi the killer if you are feeling adventurous. it is definitely nsfw/l depending on your views. ichi is one piece of work i try to get other people to read because i still have some serious unanswered questions about things.      if you are into any other kind of media let me know, i'd be up to try to find some good examples of works that use heavy symbolism.

Neutral	. i just watched a 4 hour long disclosure buffet my greer. i honestly have no reason i would doubt him. he had extensive knowledge. his history and accounts are all verifiable. he has incredibly powerful and high up people informing or working with him. this video i'm pretty sure was ten years old have no idea what he's up to these days. i am impressed he just comes out and tells you what he knows and i'm sure the only reason he's alive is because no one could even make this stuff up. if everything he says is true i don't know how he copes with a reality like that.      although tom delonge has some impressive sounding people in his "accadedemy" they are a few very smart people with nice sounding titles lou elizando who i admire for wanting to disclose, was only running a program that was disinfo at best. head of aerospace threat identification program sounds for the pentagon sounds super impressive but if greer is telling the truth he was a government coffee boy. i would bet my life savings trump i would never be read into magic12 or even told anything more than what keeps him entertained. his books were very fun to read and incredibly fun. if you know about nazj germany, vril, anartica, the post ww2 expedition, area 51, and all the publicly documented sightings in public knowledge you will learn nothing but the fictional stories about people involved in the deepest levels are a fun "look in". i think tom wants to find out the "truth" whatever the hell that is, but is way over his head. probably half his team are people that are in the know set to spread disinfo. it gets people thinking though but like i usually say baby steps are always good.

Neutral	context: i was having a discussion with a user in r/mildlyinteresting with a user about japan. this thread was well over 3 days old and the chain was hidden deep within the comments. yet, the user's comments were all upvoted to +5 and mine were instantly -2/-3. i said i suspected him of vote manipulating and that i'd be contacting the admins about it.       2 days later, i get a ban message from r/mildlyinteresting accusing me of having abused the report button(i never made a report, i use reddit mobile and the ios app doesn't allow custom reports.)  now if you recall, i made a post 2 months or so ago about a user filing false reports on my behalf there as well. i was threatened with being reported to the admins there as well, yet, here i still am. because, guess what? i didn't make the report. the language and the way the reports are written isn't even how i talk or type and again, why would i report vote manipulation to mods who can't do anything about it?      after denying the allegations and defending myself, i was told the ban was extended, no sweat off my back as the sub is notoriously bad these days and full of facebook level content. i just felt this was an appropriate forum to vent these frustrations. note that he also told me that unless i could prove my innocence, i was banned for good. this is obviously impossible as i mentioned in the screenshots and the only symbol of my innocence would be the admins messaging "we've investigated and taken action as necessary"         modmail: [URL]

Neutral	throwaway because i don't want my wife to see any of this.       yesterday my wife sat me down and explained to me that she cheated on me with someone whom i knew she was being shady with (lets name him steve). this was about a year into our marriages. and she cut things off with him after this      she was planning on killing herself and didn't care anymore. but she had changed her mind and forever lived with that guilt.       she didn't enjoy it, and after it started, she wanted it to stop, but felt trapped. she gave me some pretty descriptive details.       the real horrible bit. she didn't make him wear a condom. he pulled out, but this happened at the time we conceived my son.       she had a paternity test a year after, (while i was indisposed) and it confirmed (98% odds off) that steve was not the father.       so there is no... true damage? i'm sticking with her. she has changed. like i said i knew something was off, just not that horrible.       currently part of me is so disgusted, and the other frustrated. not to sound cliché, but i'm not mad at her, just so deeply disappointed.       am i being dumb? should i be madder? shouldn't i hate her? i'm just so sad and frustrated, but i ferl sure i could get over it

Neutral	i'm really happy to see competitive pokemon drama here. for what it's worth, on offensive sets fire blast almost always makes more sense. a weird defensive special set would run flamethrower instead though (assuming it ran any attack in addition to hyper voice). but if your team comp handled these common threats already (i.e. you have a specs magnezone) then it doesn't really matter. personally, i think special altaria is fairly bad and physical does everything better assuming you have a magnezone anyways, except for surprise factor in ladder bo1 games.      thanks for reading my ted talk.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	hey, i'm the developer of supraland. i was just shown this and was asked to share my pov.      so the baseline of what i understood is that she associates with every woman displayed anywhere. so if a woman is stupid, shy or subserviant, she feels insulted.      and my point was: everyone is an individual, you are not all of those women.      and then she said that i should also feel bad if there is a stupid man in a movie, but i have no point to feel that way. i am not that guy.      originally all stick figures in the game were male and it was also perceived as that by many, so i decided to put in female stick figures as well. so her perception that they look genderless was not shared by most.      in supraland there are a few dumb teeny fangirls admiring a suprastar. that was the worst moment for her. she says that all women in the game are weak. she ignored that the main woman, the queen, is more dominant than both of the kings and is showing them the way, and she is also ordering the player around.      so it seems that she wants all women to be strong and dominant. but the thing is, what hormons people run on is different from case to case. depending on what happened to you in your life you run on different hormons. for example when a woman loses her man, she usually becomes more masculine to be able to survive and she becomes more feminine again when she gets a man again.       some women run on masculine hormones and are the tough ones. many women are very feminine and enjoy being subserviant - and because of that nature they have no voice in public, because only dominant more masculine women are so extrovert to raise their voice. that is probably the reason for the disconnect between the media and the people.      same thing for men - many men are more on the feminine side and soft and also have a hard time in this society with it.         and my point of view in general: let everyone be just the way they are and let them do whatever they want. don't force feminine people into being masculine, don't force masculine people into being feminine. everyone is an individual.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	that's what it's always been about. when ccw permit holders (largely right wing) use firearms, it's to defend themselves against the sort of people that tend to vote democrat. democrats push gun control because their voters don't like dealing with the occupational hazards of robbing and murdering people. every time they push a gun ban policy what they are saying is 'disarm so we can kill you'

(i don't know if it's a transwoman, a transman, or a transtrender they are talking about, and really don't care)      you know ... the whole idea of giving the award to the person(s) who actually deserve it, instead of someone who deserves it less but who is 'special'.     
IdentityDirectedAbuse	this post is really stupid. i don't usually like to preach and prefer to keep to myself unless someone messes with me but sometimes something is so retarded that one must say a few things.      america is not assisting saudi arabia in killing yemenis like in ww2. seems to me that your real goal is to turn people against the saudi state.why would you compare a war in which the elected representatives of the state of yemen themselves support the saudi military intervention to intentionally aiming to wipe out specific groups of people ? the goal of the war is not the elimination of the yemenis as your post implies but rather their liberation from enemies who are using them as human shield by the threat of cutting off food supplies if they are attacked at the port city.this war exists only because the yemenis don't want to become slaves to the iranians. in fact the wfp has stated that food aid given to the yemenis is being stolen by houthi rebels and possibly sold on the black market to further their political ambitions.      yes ,indeed people hate america but i personally feel that it's merely the american state that is a threat to world peace and not americans themselves who seem like very nice people.the people of america are misled into supporting evil through propaganda.your post appears to be propaganda.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	no, it was a social democrat party. much, *much* less severe than the modern interpretation of socialism, especially the hard-liners of the dsa. and no, that's not what they were. they were fiercely anti-*communist*, no stipulations. the iron front fucking hated the nazi party and the communist party, there was no specific niche of nazi or commie they hated. the french party that used the emblem kicked out all communists. *all* communists. because they fucking shit up every country trying for decent social reform.      if three arrows is sticking to the iron front roots he should hate the far-left, because they did and still do hate social democratic policies and seek to violently overthrow democratic processes with multiple parties.

Neutral	alright, stand behind something and while you're speaking in front of a crowd, look for the sexiest person and imagine having the best sex of your life with that person.   another way of doing it is to have someone under that stand who can pleasure your sexual organ in some way. be that a hooker or your partner.   job interviews are much harder, cause you're under more surveillance than during a speech, but are still quite doable. all you have to do is pleasure yourself slower than you normally would and not look as much at your still stimulant as you would while talking to a crowd. and in case there isn't a person who looks hot enough for you to pleasure yourself, you should look for a different job.

Neutral	ender's game, despite being a morality tale, also has a *really* fuck weird (dare i say, fundamentalist christian) take on morality. the entire book is constructed so that someone is able to undertake the *impossibly unlikely* venture of committing genocide without meaning to. so of course ender isn't at fault, he never knew he was committing genocide!!! but the entire point of the book (and its sequels) are ender's moral crisis over being tricked into doing the worst thing imaginable and is just continually driving in how *it's not his fault* because he *didn't mean to*. and it's just like ". . . obviously?" and there's also weird jesus-y stuff where ender founds a religion and is scapegoated for the war etcetc all while *it was never his fault*!      they're ultimately not that deep or useful imo. basically any other book that has moral points to make is more worth your time. unless you really want to read a book where someone uses the most extreme, least likely possible example to attempt to "prove" kantian ethics.

Neutral	hey, if we agree on jones and icke, may i ask what video's or people you do agree with? just looking to broaden my views.
Neutral	no one gave you the real answer so here it is. the book that all the rotk games, shows, and movies are based off of was written a couple centuries later around the time or a bit after of the fall of the foreign khanite led dynasty, the yuan dynasty.      the northern yuan dynasty did not fall all at once, and for a while they stayed in contention with the southern ming. luo guanzhong might have been putting the names liu bei,cao cao and sun quan on paper, but it was really exposé on current or recently historical political events.       the southern ming saw themselves as fighting an illegitimate foreign dynasty to reestablish a dynasty ruled by the ethnically han people's, in the same vein as liu bei trying to reestablish the venerable han empire in shu-han from wei usurpers.      so liu bei became an allegory for the southern ming patriots and cao cao for the evil northern led yuan "usurpers". basically rotk was written to be propaganda so of course liu bei was righteous and cao cao the cynical villain.

Neutral	posting this from an alt because yeah      so, i met this trans girl (i am also trans, we are both male to female, pre everything for those of you who know what that means) on an app, and we got along pretty well. we were talking for a few days, and then out of the blue she asks to trade nudes. normally i'm only really into girls, or feminine trans girls, but i said ok. we traded a few back and forth for a bit, and it was kinda nice. which is confusing to me now because i can't normally stand seeing a dick, much less get off to one, but idk. that's not the point of my post. basically, i enjoyed it. but now i'm starting to think she's actually into me romantically. she keeps talking about cuddling, and other cutesy stuff, and she's still being pretty sexually provocative. the problem is, if she is into me, the feeling isn't mutual, and i feel weird about doing anything because it's kind of a lie. i like her, but as a friend. i don't really want to have any kind of digital relationship, be it romantic or sexual, but that seems like what she wants. i don't want to just cut her off, but i don't really know what to do. because tbh, i'd be down to trade nudes occasionally if it didn't feel like there were emotional strings attached. but idk, maybe i would still feel weird about it.       ugh
Neutral	yo i got into my first relationship at 20 after no kissing or anything, my bf didnt even know if i liked him at the time cos i took a while to reply to his texts too.                 and about the people not replying, you need to try to be comfortable with yourself first (obviously you've mentioned that you dont want to be chubby etc.) and the only reason you're boring around people imo is because you're not comfortable enough to actually let loose and have fun.                 if your conversations are boring, it's might be either the people you talk to are boring or you're trying to get through the conversation without actually wanting anything out of it, so you end up droning on and on about things because you feel like you should be talking when you don't need to be.

Neutral	because the dark side is in control and will be untill the end, atleast here on earth.             my personal guess is the ride is almost over, society has come a far way, esp in the last 100 years. mass communication, television, the internet all that.             it won't be a pleasant ending for either. lucifer already lost, almost by definition. (his is a sad path)             but go(o)d also loses i think.no matter the outcome, so much suffering and pain already passed it will linger on for eternity. from a christian point of view, even all the people who end up going to heaven will lose friends, maybe even family who won't make the cut. concidering the afterlife in most (if not all) mythologies and religions is **eternal,** i think it's safe to say everyone sorta loses at the end.             i don't think there is any action for god to take that could solve this, not without messing with our free will. humanity chose this path i guess; which is why god has allowed it.

Neutral	don't get me wrong at all, i think steam is great, it's my go-to for games. but i do raise an eyebrow when a competitor that shows actual promise comes out and the reaction from the gaming community is overwhelmingly negative.      you have all the mindless drones spreading hashtags like "nosteamnobuy" and rambling and ranting about "anticonsumer" practices while entirely ignoring the fact that steam has a near monopoly on digital games distribution on pc, something which inherently restricts consumer choice and stifles competition - the very definition of anticonsumer. but still, it's apparently an inexcusable evil when a company chooses to release a game on a store that isn't the holy steam of our lord and saviour gaben. this sounds suspiciously like a double standard.      on the steam forums i have spoken with may people whose only argument was to extol the virtues of steam as opposed to the supposed evils of the epic store for merely existing and how bethesda is literally worse than hitler for the heinous crime of using their own launcher.      it's one of the most hideous and entitled aspects of the outrage culture that has society by the neck these days. it's sad that people would rather see creativity and freedom stifled than people actually trying to innovate and compete in an industry where it's needed more than ever.      edit: illustration. one guy on the steam forums claimed to me that steam's "sole purpose" was "to increase competition and increase consumer benefit". uhhhhh... no?

Neutral	i think many people are just are not attracted to overweight people, and now days that's somehow a bad thing? i never have meet anyone who actually hated obese people. sure its annoying when people who are literally dying from obesity are shouting at you that they are healthy at any size which of course is one the dumbest thing i've ever heard. really, are we going to pretend anorexia and bulimics are healthy? no, so we should not pretend that people who weigh 300 pounds are healthy either, there is not a single piece of evidence that being fat is good for you, while there is literal mountains of evidence that being in good shape with low body fat is associated with health and longer life.      i really don't see this hatred of the overweight you speak of, just because someone isn't attracted to you and doesn't want any type of relationship with you due to your inability to take care of yourself does not mean they hate all fat people. personally i would never be with someone who is not in good shape, for a few simple reasons. 1) i take excellent care of my body and physical activity is a passion of mine, so if my s/o isn't into an active lifestyle we just wont match. 2) i want a life partner who isn't going to die in the first 50 years of their life from cancer or heart disease. 3) i'm just not physically attracted to overweight people, plain and simple, doesn't make me a bad person for having a personal preference. i work extremely hard for my low body fat % and muscles and it makes me happy, i'm much more confident, outgoing and energetic when im taking care of my body.

Neutral	the blog posts speak for themselves better than anything i could ever write, so here are a bunch of excerpts without commentary:      *"the brain size of the world's most successful woman"*:     >i have heard oprah state on her show that she has to have her hats custom made because her head measures 25.25 inches around, a cranium so large that two wigs had to be sewn together to fit her for her oscar nominated performance in *the color purple*. this equates to 641.4 mm. [...] assuming this sample is roughly representative of adult female u.s. crania, oprah's head perimeter is 6.3 sd above the mean of american women.      *"independent confirmation of oprah's head size"*:     >the late gene siskel went hat shopping with oprah and the salesman said oprah's was the largest head he'd ever seen. using the late j.p. rushton's idea of using the formula for calculating the volume of a hemisphere (v = circumfence^3 / 118.4) oprah would have a cranial capacity of 2229 cm^3...      *"brain size & ethnic genetic interests at 70th annual tony awards"*:     >i spent sunday evening trying to watch anything other than the news and i stumbled upon the 70th annual tony awards. generally speaking, high iq people tend to be fans of the arts, so it came as no surprise to see arguably the biggest brained and most successful woman on the planet, multi-billionaire oprah, dominating the event.      *"iq & fighting back against racism"*:     >oprah's 2029 cc cranial capacity gave her the iq to handle racists with style. when a skinhead called her a monkey and then tried to change the subject, oprah grabbed him by the arm and said '"i want to talk about the *monkey business*". this showed lateral thinking because they were literally talking about monkeys...      *"big brained oprah triples the value of weight watchers stock; could make $100 million in 36 hours"*:     >with a cranial capacity of perhaps 2,029 cm^3, oprah has just adapted her situation to her advantage, by buying a 10% share in weight watchers, and watching the stock roughly triple in a few days, making her potentially $100 million richer in only 36 hours.      *"big brained oprah tried to stop the war with iraq"*:     >while no human in history has had a deviation iq much beyond 200, oprah's 2,029 cc estimated brain size is arguably around what you would statistically expect from a 400 iq being, and so was the wisdom she displayed in the run-up to the war in iraq. [...] it seems marvelously symbolic that oprah, arguably the biggest brained member of america's elite ultimately passed that test with such flying colours, and got on the right side of history.      *"getting rich off cold winter genes"*:     >...one day oprah's enormous brain size seemed to allow her the higher level cognitive ability that transcended cognitive abilities themselves: meta cognition; self-awareness [...] how did oprah display self-awareness? martha stewart began showing oprah a very efficient way to maneuver a bed sheet, and asked oprah to grap one corner of the bed sheet. sensing she didn't have the spatial ability to perform the task competently and not wanting to look foolish in front of millions of tv viewers, oprah was forced to adapt. instead of grabbing the corner of the sheet, oprah spontaneously ran to the audience to grab a martha stewart fan.      *"only ashkenazi jews were smart enough to compete with oprah"*:     >as a compassionate social darwinist, i watched in great fascination as arguably the biggest brained member of both her race and her gender, emerged as the world's richest black and the world's most influential woman. [...] it seemed to me her huge brain size was giving her an ability to come up with witty comments, and down-home folksy wisdom that kept the audience entertained. [...] with a cranial capacity almost as stratospheric as oprah's, rosie [o'donnell] had the smarts to become the only gentile in syndicated talk show history to almost beat oprah in the ratings      *"has any self-made woman or black in history ever been the most powerful person on earth?"*:     >the only self-made woman and the only black who has come close to being the most powerful person on earth has been oprah, who for years reigned as the billionaire queen of all media and kingmaker to obama's presidency, but she was born with a freakishly large brain size which helped make her especially smart. [...] had her iq been even higher still (150 instead of 140), she might have made the leap from presidential king maker to president.      *"how oprah cured my homophobia"*:     >...to hear the world's most influential woman give [a political opinion] that was so succinct, loud, powerful and graphic, and on behalf of an oppressed minority other than her own, just brought the house down. in that moment, my homophobia was cured. [...] rather than trying to defend an awkward argument, oprah had the cognitive adaptability to shift gears completely, by saying "i wasn't trying to absurd, sir" [...] big brained oprah then cleverly used her power which he did not have, by cutting to commercial break.      *"big brained black billionaire"*:     >a thousand years from now, when no one even knows who oprah was, anthropologists might dig through the soil and discover a skeleton with a colossal cranial capacity and assume it belonged to someone extremely intelligent.  they'll think it must have belong to some rare super human, perhaps a more evolved species.  they might then discover the remains of her massive brick mansion and realize her intelligence allowed her to rule over the other humans of her time.      *"beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...beautiful brain"*:     >but the ultimate brain scan art would be if oprah posed intimately with other luminaries, since oprah's arguably both the biggest brained member of both her race and her gender and the most successful member of both her race and her gender. the mri scan could be displayed in the oprah winfrey wing of the **smithsonian's** new national museum of african american history and culture.

Neutral	two of the three largest nuclear disasters in human history resulted in no fatalities and negligible environmental effects. chernobyl was a special case of impressive levels of soviet mismanagement. what happened then would have never been possible without a massive helping of human stupidity and bureaucracy. even then, chernobyl today is more or less a nature preserve with a couple hot spots.            nuclear is the least deadly per kw/h of any energy source we currently have access to, including solar and wind. nuclear is the best bet we have for cleaning up the environment any kind of soon, especially with the new theoretical thorium reactors that could revolutionize the industry and drastically reduce the risks involved.           fusion would be nice, but even if we managed to break even tomorrow it would still be decades before material science advances enough to make the machines capable of withstanding the energy they have to hold. work with what you have, not with what you wish for. nuclear is what we have today and what we should be investing all of our efforts into clean energy into.          that's one of the things that pissed me off about the new green deal; it completely ignored nuclear energy.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	fuck the media, and fuck the advertisers that pay them too. the media has already been proven to be a bunch of scumbag liars that only exist to stir shit up throughout the world. sites like reddit shouldn't abandon their original user base by making unnecessary changes that everyone besides the media/advertisers hates. but hey, if they want to go full digg, let them. reddit has already become less popular according to recent stats, and there will definitely be another site that takes its place.

Neutral	100% agree. i consider myself rather conservative in most things, but for healthcare i might be interested in a taxpayer-funded scheme *if it could be done well*. i think there are potential cost savings in such a scheme if it's handled properly.       calling me names and saying i want poor people to die isn't gonna get anyone anywhere, though, and that's exactly what this debate has become.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	cb... yet again we are at a cross roads my old friend, you of all people should know that sex/gender/anatomy/penises and vaginas. are all social constructs. through psudosciecne we have discoved that the only thing that matters is how you feel on the inside. and if a person is basically bipolar to the extreme then that feeling on the inside can change on a moments notice. so what right do we have to force our "antiquated" and "bigoted" patriarchy created systems of oppression on innocent non-binarys?. we need to come to the realization that the patriarchy led by donald trump is lying to us. before donald trump came along no one cared what your gender was. but ever since orange man bad cheeto pres took over its literally a death sentence for me to leave my moms basement as someone might lynch me for being a quasi gay demi trans homo fag.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	now you're just naming random laws and claiming they're somehow "white supremacist". how exactly is our immigration policy "white supremacist" ? we don't let illegals from canada or monaco in either. the fact that we border a poor region of the world where people are hispanic doesn't make our laws white supremacist. we border canada too. is it legal for canadians to sneak over the border? no. no it fucking is not. we just don't have 132,887 canadians sneaking over our northern border in one month like we do on our southern border.       >the criminal justice system.        which specific law says that skin color determines your outcome in our criminal justice system? which country on planet earth has a fairer criminal justice system and why?       > the effective defunding of public schools in low income neighborhoods by using property taxes to fund education.        i don't follow. why is it "white supremacist" to fund public schools by property taxes? asians outearn every other race. maybe it's asian supremacist?       > there are plenty of policies and systems still in place that benefit wealthy white people disproportionately at the expense of working class, people of color.       literally everyone is free to take advantage of these laws that you can't even name. if a law benefits the rich, it hurts black and white poor people equally, and helps black and white rich people equally.  there are precisely zero racist laws on the books. saying otherwise is a lie unless you are weasely enough to change the definition of the term to win an argument?

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	meh, "getting laid is easy" is probably one of the dumbest angles possible on incels, that has nothing to do with what truly make incels bad and put too much weight on them having sex to stop being incels instead of just dropping the ideology.      the implication that you *should* have sex at all cost even with someone you are not attracted to is not super cool either and would probably fuck up an incel even more while making them much less likely to listen to normal people ever again.
Neutral	difficulty isn't about what you are able to do, anything can seem impossible until it's done. but it's about the things you have to do to get to the finish.      it can be very tedious and boring. it can be a badly designed area where you constantly get blasted by enemies. it can be a bullshit boss design that insta kills you with certain strikes or heals itself.      a game can be difficult without being tedious. the division 2 is a good example of it. it challenges in a way that makes playing it satisfying. although it has some bullshit parts like the fucking roosevelt island, that last area in the stronghold was so ungodly annoying since there weren't good places to take cover and bt would just keep blasting me with their mini tanks and grenadiers. on the other hand i was able to do the capitol hill stronghold pretty easily since it was designed in a better way.

Neutral	the world's elephant population has been in a dramatic decline for the last several decades from poachers, human-elephant conflicts, and profiteers. they are in danger all over the world. in africa, 100 elephants are killed every day for their ivory. that number is increasing yearly. 2015 was the first year when the number of elephants being killed was more than those being born. if this disparity continues, african elephants could face extinction within our lifetime. in asia, though poaching for ivory is a serious problem as well, elephants are also being killed for their skin. whereas in africa only elephants with ivory are killed, every asian elephant is a target for their skin which means that they could face extinction sooner than african elephants. additionally, in asia, many elephants are facing an unnatural and cruel life by also being kept in captivity for a variety of purposes: logging, tourism, cultural and religious activities, and transportation.
Neutral	i live in utah, where the polygamy a couple generations ago has created some interesting population dynamics. you had these huge families where everyone was related to at least one person, and that's ended up inescapably propagating down the line because most people are still living and marrying in the same part of the state their ancestors were. it's also why the lds church keeps a huge geneology database - back when it was established they were trying to figure out who was related to who.      anecdotally my brother married a distant cousin without realizing it (their kids are fine fortunately), and i've got some other cousins who are having a lot of children with cleft palates and hip dysplasia problems, and i suspect they're probably related on some level as well. 2-3% increase in birth defects doesn't seem like it's so bad until you see it happening to people you know and you see the pain and  the costs.      that said, they have every right to keep having kids as is the mormon wont, and they'll just keep paying for the surgeries on infants. i suppose it's similar for other people who find they're both at an increased risk for deformity even without the ancestral relations.

Neutral	i'm just so tired of not being an important part of the lives of the people that are important to me. i know, many of you could say i'm important to my family but come on, it's only because we are blood-related. i mean my friends. i have never been someone's best friend, never. not that i'm aware of. it feels as if i'm only a temporary friend, not one that lasts. this really gets me down lately. and to make things worse, i found out my best friend doesn't even care about me. i don't know why but since the start of the year, he has been different with me. he recently formed a new group of friends and slowly he has started to grow apart from me. i now know he doesn't care about me, but his still my best friend. we used to talk everyday, now if he doesn't see me during school hours, he doesn't even send me a message. if i don't look up for him or talk to him, he just ignores me. i have come to think he grew tired of being my friend, as everyone i know. this always happens to me. nevertheless, i still want his friendship and his approval, even when he has done me so many bad things. some days it looks as if i'm really his best friend, but other days, he completely ignores my existence. it's just too much. i feel too much, and i always overthink too much. i try to talk to him but he just shoves me off. i'm just so tired of constantly feeling like a piece of garbage. nobody really cares about me.

Neutral	sort of as an aside, i'd never looked at freejinger until i saw them mentioned on reddit.  i thought it was sort of cute how friendly those peeps were with one another, considering the purpose of the site. :)  it definitely drifted from snark to "best friend's basement after the football game" to "moms at a coffee shop".

Neutral	it's amazing how these people have such a lack of self awareness. it's incredible
Neutral	also you should see if your votes are even working at all. i noticed lately that none of my upvotes or downvotes work. i'll upvote/downvote someone and refresh and they will still be at the same exact number that they were at before. it's this way even when the people i'm upvoting/downvoting only have a single point which is automatically given. i found that in order for the vote to even register at all i'll have to upvote/downvote the person, refresh, un-upvote/un-downvote them to remove my vote, refresh, and than i'll finally be able to upvote/downvote with it registering.      basically if you are voting against what they want you to vote as than your vote is being ignored.
Neutral	what if i have google wifi : /
Neutral	same thing for me. i also have some shitty teeth today because my parents didn't teach me to brush as a child. spine problems, including scoliosis. they never put me in school either so now i'm 23 with almost no educational background. i've also had trouble breathing my entire life and never got checked it with a doctor...      it sucks because you know it was their responsibility to take care of you and teach you while you were a child, but it just feels wrong blaming them for that and i actually like them. sorry for ranting on your post.
Neutral	that sub is literally the most perfect example of this xkcd that i've ever seen.
Neutral	i agree. it's all these rat race jobs that drove me crazy and made me confused as hell. i became a nurse 7 years ago. it's not easy. it's still work. but i make good money. i help people. i work 3 days a week. i work my shift. i do the best i can and go home. i don't give a shit what my boss thinks as long as i'm not in trouble. this seems to be a common thread in trades. i feel like they are underrated as job options.

Neutral	that reads more like a politician's speech than it does an internet comment. i doubt real templates used by pr groups are this fake looking.      and if it's supposed to be a real template, why does it not show up in search results anywhere else? what's the point of having a template that you only use once?

Neutral	i love your progress, good job
Neutral	there is a german restaurant by my house that claims to serve authentic german food (take that with a grain of salt, i'm in america). i suppose only  white people are allowed to eat there, although that would be racist, so maybe people who aren't white should be given their own seperate areas? perhaps even their own soda fountains and bathrooms as well. we can make cute little signs so that everyone knows what area belongs to who. unfortunately, the restaurant is quite small, so the non whites will have to eat in the back.

"one of the super smart ones on reddit..."  cmon bruh.  also he assumes i'm a sociology student but there are several comments i've made and an [USER] flair indicating i do atmospheric science, so another check in the sexism box.  sigh.             i assume it was because i occasionally comment on [USER] threads.... with a male symbol flair.  i guess if i'm interested in the opinions and thoughts of women i must be a woman smh.  felt sorry for the guy tbh

Neutral	incidentally i love that in spanish 'america' is explicitly called 'north-america' because this continent is bigger than some weird pilgrim colony.
Neutral	one thing i've realized as this is happening and looking at different points of view is that this has nothing to do with benefiting the consumer. it's not like epic is providing a better service than steam. in fact, if you look at their capabilities, they are providing a lesser service (with less functions). the game and the content is the same. all of the benefits are for the developer. i mean if we look at the situation with taxis and ride shares, it's clear where the consumer is getting a better deal. so realistically, it's just an unpleasant situation but no unexpected. it's a business first and they go where the money is.       that being said competition is healthy when it drives businesses towards improvements. but that's not what epic is doing right now. they aren't even addressing the consumer, which is evident by their store being so unfinished. they are addressing the developers. once they have amassed enough clout in the business, they might start offering benefits to customers but right now, it's not about the public. it's about the gaming development industry.      i'll freely admit i never buy a game at launch. it has nothing to do with it being buggy or something like that. i just don't have the money. i have to wait until everything is released and on sale (even if it's an ok sale and not a great 75% sale). i've waited for borderlands 3 for this long. i can wait some more.

Neutral	honestly, there are a lot of things that need to be addressed. it's certainly achievable, but it's not going to be a simple fix by passing a bill that says the government pays for everything. we will need to tackle tort reform, because litigation costs around 4% of all medical expenses. we would also have to address the fact that  medical school is a lot more expensive in the united states, which means doctors have to charge more to their patients to cover their student loans. we also need to be realistic about the fact that we have a much higher obesity rate than other countries, which adds another 2% to 7% of  our total healthcare costs. pharmaceutical costs are higher here and i think they could be reduced a little with cooective bargaining with a uhc but not down to european levels like sanders suggests.        there are a lot of things that need to be addressed. the problem is that none of them are the root cause by themselves, so dealing with them is necessary to get a universal healthcare system.       i support a uhc, but it's wishful thinking to believe the current legislation will fix it on its own

Neutral	first and foremost, your feelings are legitimate and important. the fact that your mother survived her childhood has no bearing on your feelings and whether or not you deserve to have them. please take care of yourself, future you will be grateful for it.       most colleges give students access to mental health professionals, as the first year can be rough for many. my ex used them, i've used them; it helps to just have an unbiased party to talk to. i will caution you to brace yourself, talk therapy is designed to help you figure out why you're having these feelings, why you're depressed. sometimes those are hard bridges to cross, but i promise it gets easier.       usually i'm against taking student loans, but that may be a viable option for you to pay for your dorms, or even housing close to campus, which can be cheaper. if you're practical and realistic with what you borrow, you may be able to get out with minimal debt.       and for what it's worth, save this number, it could save you: 1-800-273-8255 (suicide prevention hotline)

IdentityDirectedAbuse	so someone was discussing the idea of a gay/lesbian person being attracted to one person of the opposite sex, and if that would make them automatically bisexual. i innocently commented that there have been stories i've read online of homosexual people talking about that exception, and that they still overall consider themselves homosexual.      cue the double digit downvotes and snark from redditors who claim that's bullshit and it "never happens". it's funny (and hypocritical) how the lgbt+ community harps about fluidity in sexuality yet they themselves are super fucking rigid about labels. because gays can never, ever, ever find someone else of the opposite sex attractive or fall for them otherwise. nope. never happens.      just fuck this website, fuck the lgbt+ community. i know, i know. "why are you still on here?" well, i've barely been posting lately so i am weaning myself off this place little by little...

Neutral	virgin is someone who has never had sex. you need a partner to have sex. you must be able to attract a partner. as such, being called a virgin = being unable to attract a partner. therefore, you have failed your biological purpose. as such, you are technically a failure. your inability to attact a partner is attributed to poor looks, poor personality, or poor status. therefore, you could be ugly, boring, toxic, broke, etc.       being called a virgin is essentially being called ugly or poor or boring. basically incompetent to attract anybody.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i am not a tim.      i was born in the land of rust and grew to manhood before the foreigners knocked down our towers.  i knew men of the tim tribe back then. they went off at a young age to teach our language and serve at expensive restaurants in the land of tentacle rape porn and stinky fermented cabbage.  i was not one of them.      my tribe were those who ran the great factories. i learned to join metal together and to squeeze oil into any shape i chose. i build machines to build other machines that men and women wanted. in time, the brothers and sisters of my tribe who made those machines with me were replaced. in time, even the great factories of my homeland were moved to other nations in service of the masters.  i was chosen from among my tribe to teach those foreign men how to join metal and press oil into any shape we chose.      for many years i walked the earth.  i went to the countryside of my own land. and when those farmers became too expensive, i went to mexico and ate tacos and played with latinas and montezuma had his revenge on me.  and when the men of mexico became too expensive, i went to brazil.  and i ate beef and chased european latinas and bolivar had his revenge on me.  and when the men of brazil became too expensive, i went to china.  and i chased rainy and had laduzi.      and here i saw the tims of the new generation.  i knew them by their unruly hair and their cargo pants.  i passed by them, and inwardly i wept for their degeneracy. for i know that the life of a tim ends only in sadness and a dollar more than minimum wage at the quicken loans or ryanair.      these tims think they are the first to walk the earth. but they are not.  they are just the latest generation of another ancient tribe, scraped from the bottom of our nation. and someday, the masters will take me away from china when their men become too expensive. and i will wander on to india where i will get deli belly, or to vietnam for pho-flavored diarrhea.  i will leave behind these tims with their shrinking salaries and weakening visa options.      i will go on until the masters put me out to pasture, perhaps in one of the lands they have sent me too.

Neutral	i didn't know about the sub here on reddit but i used to read freejinger a few years ago and figured it played into things somehow. for the record i didn't even go there for dirt on the duggars, i was never interested in them, there were some other fundies i was keeping track of.

Neutral	sadly, they're not.      i posted this to [USER] around the time this was posted and they all dog piled on the guy because his reply was a bit "smug" and "douchey".      fucking no mention of the nazi adjacent person above him, hell, a lot of em said they had a point! that they just weren't a "shining example" and that the things they said didn't make them wrong. my replies pointing out this hypocrisy garnered more downvotes than i've ever had. i said such terrible things along the lines of... "isn't espousing the superiority of any race/gender worse than being a smarmy cunt?" and they reacted as though i'd just slid my fist inside whatever fucking vein pushes the milk out of the tit.      i'm a british liberal and i'm so left leaning that it'd make most of you puke but the two things i value above all else are firstly that logic and facts are more important than feelings and that freedom of discourse is a requirement for a progressive society.      but neither of those things are requirements of these people! 25 years of life and not one right leaning individual has managed to change my beliefs but these fucking amoeba just being on the same team as me has resulted in my rethinking things. fucking **idiots.**
PersonDirectedAbuse	isn't pete davidson that unfunny shithead that just a few months ago everyone thought was suicidal because some girl broke up with him?  now he's lecturing people on the catholic church?      man, remember when snl had actual comedians on instead of preachers on the pulpit?  think back to the early 90's when sinead o'connor ruined her career over tearing up a picture of the pope, now we get this dumb shit.
Neutral	we need to know the time they took the screenshot!      (/s just in case.)
Neutral	very one-sided explanation of the color yellow. yellow has been used in advertising to grab the attention and create feelings of positivity. the problem with the psychology of colors is that every color explains 'two sides' of the spectrum. the positive and the negative side.              i think it has to do with the fact that it indeed was the only 70s color that really stimulates you, visually, therefore they made good use of it. either way, if they want to signal urgency and danger, they could have also used red. which was not a 70s color.              i think your assessment to a certain degree is correct, but the color has more likely been used to emphathize on the duality of ted bundy. who, like many other serial killers, has been perceived as a very kind man by his surroundings. yellow is a color that either stimulates very positive emotions or very negative emotions.
Neutral	at this time in my life, considering all that's occurred in my life, i'm pretty sure i'm what you would classify as asexual. no desire for sexual contact or sexual relationships. the concept of sex alone makes me uncomfortable.      this makes it hard to have any discussions about my current relationship with my girlfriend because the people in my life that i love dearly keep telling me that "i don't know what i'm missing" and "you'll change your mind after you have sex for the first time" like no you guys aren't understanding i don't want to have sex and they just can't understand the concept.      my mother claims it makes no sense, and that my natural desire as a human being should be to breed and it's just frustrating because otherwise my family are wonderful people. it just frustrates me sometimes, and then i feel bad because asexuality is so uncommon that no, they shouldn't immediately understand it.      but i hope they can, even if they don't understand it, at least support me and my feelings sometime down the line. i won't lose sleep or hate them or anything but i would like to not hear "you just don't know yet" anymore.

Neutral	the 'het' part refers to hetero-*romantic*. it's a split attraction model thing to include people with romantic attraction for the opposite gender but lacking in sexual attraction.
Neutral	you're probably right. if it was a noose, it was a poorly constructed one. i personally would have said something to someone in charge to find out what it was, and that's what that woman should have done. at the very least she would have saved the company from some safety regulation violations.
Neutral	cao cao best warlord.
Neutral	it's funny how they have to misrepresent "women and girls who like homoerotic smut" as "women with sexual interests". they can't even really say "there's nothing wrong with liking smut about dudes who like dudes", they have to cry misogynist wolf. i tried to come up with an analogy. the closest i got was furries, and even that's off.      notice how op has no problem with the western slash/yaoi fangirls who call themselves "fujoishi", just the people who use the term as a pejorative. even though it has negative connotations in japanese too.      and, of course, let tired-fan use the term to make basically the same criticisms spooky did, without blocking 'em.

Neutral	there was a bedbug infestation last year in my dorm, so i shifted out with my belongings to a new room. here's what i did:      1. discard stuff you don't need, and the ones you do decide to keep, double or triple check them for bedbugs. anything that's been stationary for too long and has crevices/folds (like travel bags) are most likely to have them. plastic items don't usually have them, but you can never be 100% sure.      2. keep your clothes and pretty much everything you decide to retain out on the terrace in the bright sun for a week or so.      3. wash them all in steamy hot water.

Neutral	here's where i think the distinction lies - i may be wrong, and call me out if you want, but here goes:      so, believe all victims is a good and noble idea at a basic level.  when a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons.      this becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation.      with the jussie smollett case, we see both of those in play.  when the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  the second set is more nuanced, but this is how i see it:  his claims had a major effect to divide the country.  seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  when we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in chicago, apparently knowing where smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding.      in short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.

Neutral	two years of unfettered investigation by hundreds of lawyers and agencies. millions of dollars spent. still not a shred of 'collusion'.       what exactly was done to 'illegally obtain' the office? some facebook ads by trolls? considering that states control their elections and not the federal government, it's pretty hard to 'steal' a presidential election. obama himself said this. these people are so fucking delusional.
Neutral	it comes under social science.
Neutral	it's a lot cheaper than hiring someone here. instead of google(biggest h1b visa abuser i'm aware of) shelling out a standard starting salary of $150k for a us work, they can start someone out at 80k from india or europe excluding germany.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	transtrenders remind me of that episode of the office where the jackass boss guy burns his foot and then acts like he knows everything there is to know about being disabled and refuses to listen to those who have actually lived with a disability.  burning your foot and being on crutches for a week sucks, but it's not nearly at the level of being bedridden for a year or having a chronic condition.  being gender-nonconforming can suck, but it's not nearly at the level of being trans.
Neutral	it's just people trying not to overindulge into really tempting food in front of them.

Neutral	yeah i was wondering where the op was getting any of this info from if he's not even a mason, how would anyone even know. and i read all that bull about the occult being associated with masonry goes back to the crusades and how the knights would refuse to convert to islam when being tortured so somehow a goats head was involved with that and that's the whole baphomet crap we see today. but anyway, when you say "keeping secrets is our thing" the secrets you masons keep, are these like secret handshake inconsequential secrets or like secrets of history type of things? if you can answer that it would be cool (that is if you are a mason).
Neutral	we are not the opposite of your beliefs, the universe isn't centered around you. it is inevitable that the liberals will turn against the moment they begin to take us seriously. the goal is to organize as much as possible before that time comes. not go and wine to the imperial state and demand the let you go back to posting direct threats to murder specific law enforcement officials at specified times (literally the fucking first ammendment wouldn't even save you here).
Neutral	i don't know specifically about san francisco but in many places if the courts are impacted that time they'll let misdemeanor thefts go.  i have the distinct displeasure of needing to spend time in vacaville where regional thieves have it all figured out.  i've picked the brains of the cops at starbucks and they've laid it all out.  i told one guy that i'm hoping to get my family out of there, he said the same.  one cop told me that when they catch someone stealing with cold facts and they want to actually to have it stick then they'll spend a few hours driving around to look for their car stash.  otherwise its a hard wash and they're back out there the next day.  its so shitty of a system.

Neutral	what sort of person looks at a movie called "alita: battle angel" where alita battles people a lot based on a comic where where alita battles people a lot and promoted as "alita battles people a lot", and thinks people only like it because of alita's innocent naivete?      i'm pretty sure wongbal didn't actually check why the "neckbeards" liked the movie. because the romance subplot is widely considered the **weakest** part of the film.      spoilers follow      i also like how alita "has to be taught how to do everything". "everything" apparently doesn't include **battling**. which is, again, *what people are seeing the movie for*. the reason she doesn't know about civilian life is, implicitly, she's never *been* a civilian.

Neutral	the "science" subreddits don't have anything to do with science.  they're all ideological echo chamber designed to keep "the wrong ideas" out of the spotlight.      that said, this blog does a shitty job of characterizing the responses they received. the bioresearcher didn't say animal studies were unreliable.  that was the author's interpretation of their response.  they said that animal testing has known limitations.  there's a huge difference between "unreliable" and "has known limitations."  going on to call the respondent a "vivisectionist" didn't help their case any, either.  there's no way the author could know that the respondent actually cut animals open as part of their work.  using the term was just an attempt at emotional manipulation while personally attacking the respondent.      i'd like to see the threads in question to be certain, but based on the blog post itself it sounds like the author went in with an ax to grind and pissed everyone of from the word go.  it's no wonder they were being accused if being a preachy vegan.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	a few years ago, i went to a fighting game tournament.      i was there to see some sf4, and some big names were there (jwong, fchamp, snake eyes).    of course, being a large tournament, there were other games. guilty gear, skullgirls (a tranny got 2nd place on this one), mortal kombat, all the usual games. of course, this includes smash.      smash was kept in a separate room, attached to the large conference hall. it was an individual conference room, about the size of a tennis court. i walked in to check it out.      this room was filled with males, ranged 13 to 30. all of their combined body odor, smelly feet, and sweat patches assaulted my nose immediately. most were wearing graphic tee shirts and athletic mesh shorts. this allows the smell to escape much more easily than jeans. white nike new balances or sandals. most were wearing backpacks.      i've mostly forgotten about it, because it was years ago, but i will never forget that smell.       when i read this post, i could smell it again. i can't think of a logical, scientific reason for this response.       i don't understand why a long post from r/imjustabagofhammers would trigger this memory in me.       i don't know why, but i do know this: i never want to remember that smell again.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	there was really good episode about incels on vox's the weeds that i highly recommend.       incels are absolutely shitty people, but i think the bigger picture here is that there exists massive online reactionary ecosystems that thrives on radicalizing young lonely men.       people being insecure about their looks and having an unsuccessful dating life is, like, a really common thing that has been happening since forever. the difference now is that the likes of youtube and reddit are giving massive influence platforms to mras, puas, red-pillers and incels, and they're using these platforms to recruit more misogynists and further radicalizing them. instead of lonely guys growing out of their teenage insecurities, misogyny and dating issues, they're now finding an ideology that convinces them that they'll die alone and unloved because women are inherently evil creatures.

Neutral	why is this sub so lousy with it in anyone's post? no one posts here to debate or to even look at the evidence that they are wrong in their conspiracies (many of which have been disproven or are just plain incorrect from the onset).      yes i know some conspiracies can happen and have happened, but if you can not debate the possible reliability or accuracy of the evidence, then why do you post?      are most of these posts trolls trying to sound like idiots ignoring all evidence just because it is "mainstream?" so you find one singular article or youtube that "proves" your conspiracy, and that somehow automaticly makes it true?      i get downvoated for stating scientific fact proven by many studies, independent and not, not a singular unresearched biased article from a christian website that has (again) been disproven many years ago.      why do yall post then refuse to consider any of the facts?

Neutral	what counts as "queer" anyway? it used to mean "homosexual", but it now seems like an asymmetrical haircut and wearing doc martens is enough to be "queer". i'm half-joking but lgbtq, the l is for "lesbian" and the is for "gay" so what is the q? if it means "homosexual" then isn't that covered by the l or the g? also, why not get rid if the l and the g and replace with h for "homosexual"? it's just repeating the same thing otherwise isn't it?

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	> i don't really care about being labelled though.       you don't care about being labeled, and yet you choose on giving yourself a label that doesn't even supposedly fully match you if you have to distance yourself from that degree. even if we are using them, labels aren't inherently bad. they help give a clear idea of a concept to help identify with others. to quote dear white people, "without labels, people in florida would drink windex."      > care wether or not people on the internet associate me with a hate group or not.      people on the internet are people in the real world too. while there's a cover of anonymity, that really only is a freeing spot for people who stay quiet about their shitty views "in real life," not toward people who find fault with a group that acts as a gateway and enabler to way too many hate groups.      >  all i wanted to say here is that not all users of incel plattforms are mysogynistic lunatics.      a lot of them are, and even among the ones who aren't, something doesn't have to go to the extreme of rape or terrorism to still be a problem. it's like when people say "not everyone [x] is a frothing racist!      the fact that the description is even viewed as the most extreme scenario is in itself reductive. there are healthier ways to deal with these feelings than to go onto groups like mras, mgtow, incels that prey on insecure young men and there are plenty of people that would agree with you without the nasty misogynistic garbage.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	guns are not the problem just like video games weren't the problem. why do countries enlist or conscript young men? what happens when you remove all hope from a young man? what happens when you tell a young man from the time that he is old enough to learn that he is what is wrong with the world? what happens when you pump a young, hormonal, easily malleable full of wall to wall gore and death? what happens when you remove all male influences from that young man's life? his father is out of the picture, his teachers are all female, the advertisements and films he watches portray men as bumbling or stupid.      i welcome the downvotes, because every single one reinforces how right i am: women should have never be given the right to vote. america has been in absolute decline since women were included in politics. the feminization of everything has left young males with no outlet for their undeveloped minds and bodies to release anger. eventually video games about shooting up airports and films about shooting up <insert america's enemy of the week> is not enough and that rage presents itself with massacres at elementary schools.       or the government is training autistic people with radio waves into hardened mkultra killers. whatever helps you avoid an uncomfortable truth.

Neutral	i feel like a lot of the issue is that there is a huge disconnect in the three "main" ways that trap is used.  it's used in 1) porn 2) anime/manga 3) towards real people. in the third way it's super offensive, because like you said it's implying trans women aren't real women. in the first two however, it's not always referring to trans women. while i'm sure that there are trans women in "trap" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. in that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to "trick" men, so it's an accurate description. finally, when it comes to anime/manga the characters are also male identifying, outside of the (extremely rare) series where characters are transexual, and in those those issues are often addressed.

Neutral	while this poster doesn't really get very deep on why they're an anti-natalist, these types of objections have been addressed by antinatalists. generally, there is going to be some sort of argument that pain is more potent than pleasure, and that nonexistence contains no pain or pleasure, and is thus a preferable state of affairs. arguments for the first claim normally appeal to a general preference to not "trade" pain for pleasure: e.g. you wouldn't trade an hour of the most intensive possible pain for an hour of the most intensive possible pleasure.

Neutral	i'd heard a claim that the main difference between reddit and tumblr is that on tumblr you actually have to look for the white nationalism, while on reddit you can stumble across it unintentionally.
Neutral	they genocided many groups of people because they had more nationalist tendencies rather than respect for some moscow bureaucrats.  another reason why the holodomor is not respected as much as the holocaust was because its far less sexy to die because of withering expropriation/impossible taxation of your grain rather than outright being gassed. also jews were overrepresented in the soviet leadership as well as nkvd.
Neutral	once reddit was pegged as a "serious" marketing/pr tool (think back when politicians started doing amas) and a significant political platform/forum in general (everywhere from conspiracy communities to mundane right to repair stuff), i believe things were marked downhill. this is because people will invariably want to meddle with the message and there is an entire job field that gets paid to do so.       censorship is a combination of nefarious intent and the people running the site trying to close pandoras box.      you don't have to be a hipster to say obscurity does pay sometimes.

Neutral	you said you'd do **anything** remember? beggars can't be choosers.
Neutral	in the us i think it's different in most cases. like some schools only give one type of degree, regardless of the field.      eg i'm getting my ba in computer science (and at my school, all bachelors degrees are ba's, including physics, bio, chemistry etc).      i know there are some schools (often schools with a heavy engineering focus) where you can get a bs in art or english.      so i don't think the letters necessarily imply the program is accredited by any specific organization (other than a standard accreditation board).

Neutral	the trump presidency proves this wrong. his election was a middle finger to the established elites on both sides of the aisle. the republicans have been making the best of a bad situation but trump's election has raised a lot of questions about the future of the party due to the fact that his election has brought about a growing division of the cultural conservatives, business conservatives, and libertarian conservatives. on the other side of the aisle, the 2016 election has empowered farther left candidates while significantly eroding the credibility of the democrat establishment.      the vote doesn't matter until it does.

Neutral	being celibate doesn't necessarily mean you're ace. i know guys who dated, liked it just fine, and just felt the priesthood was their calling and not marriage. vice versa, too. my cousin married a guy who spent 2 years of their relationship debating whether or not he was going to go into the seminary. i know a woman who was a nun for 7 years, left before her final vows, and married a guy who left the seminary before becoming a priest. there's a pair of saints who were married, had like 12 kids, and became a monk and a cloistered nun after their kids grew up. celibacy is complicated and has more possible reasons than just being ace, especially when religion is involved.

Neutral	either accept the reality or change it.      **i propose that once upon a time reddits subreddits were about discussing a subject.**      so [USER] would be about discussing food. [USER] about discussing news.   the same way even the political and other more divisive subreddits were about the subject itself.      even if [USER] was run by a socialist and [USER] by a capitalist the purpose was not to create a community of socialists or capitalists but discuss the subjects, events and happenings concerning them.      today almost no sub is about about discussing it **but being part of it, being supportive of it, being loyal to it.**   (exceptions for like "true, or truetrue subs).      this is why td bans even supporters of **donald trump** when critically analyzing the presidents actions in say his ever more hawkish appointments.       or why various socialist subs ban outright **socialist members** for lifting the issue in venezuela from a critical point of view.      or even why the mods in [USER] will ban you for criticizing someones food, or notion of food or beauty or taste of food.       the concept of what a sub is about has changed. or rather what a sub is *for*. subreddits are no longer divisions of topics but divided communities.       i remember on one of my older accounts one of my first banishments was in a subreddit for something literally called "[USER]" (from the movie soylent green) and rebranded as something positive. i was absolutely downvoted and then banished after a prolonged discussion (with little give and take) and i've seen this mannerism now spread to all sectors of reddit.       we either need to change this very fundamental of perception in ourselves or we must accept that even completely benign and neutral subreddits like say [USER] or your local subreddit will be taken over by a particular group and that group will congregate around their definition of the subject and then proceed to isolate voices that do not adhere to that as it progresses to define itself, whether openly or subconsciously.          we must rethink what we use reddit for or concede that this is the future.               ____         a way to stop this would be to change a fundamental concept of reddit. to forbid subreddits from having selective enforcing based on any stance on any one issue.       so you could talk as much shit about socialism as you wanted in a socialist sub as you could talk shit about capitalism in a capitalist sub as long as you followed the rest of the subs rules.       i honestly think that it's either this or we might as well shut up about it, because organic change might not come about as all the subs are now protecting themselves against brigading and "concern trolling" and other such things the same way an arms race in real life functions. so either make them all bend the knee or the struggle is pointless. but at least we can come to a common understanding of why it is happening, hence this thread. this way we can also stop acting out as victims of a particular ideology, religion, sex, location, interest or what ever when we get banned.  we are victims of one side of reddit, nothing else, sadly.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	why people can't see the writing on the wall is beyond me. incentives for foreigners to come to western nations to over throw them? obviously the elites want elimination of western culture and values (christianity). this is the locust army of the revelation 13, the muslims in europe, and the latinos and other ethnic non natives in the usa imo. the mark of the beast comes when we can no longer buy or sale at amazon because we made a bad post about pedophiles on our social media. if you say something derogatory about transgenders, your company will fire you and you will be put on billboards for having a poor social credit score. the image of the beast is the tv / smart phone screens. the super natural messiah of the beast system will return within 15 years imo.

Neutral	democracy tricks thousands of people into thinking the vote is the beginning and end of their political power when true power lies in and always has been in political activism.    the rich and the well-educated know this, and the vote basically just acts to appease the lower classes, and absolve public officials of responsibility, because, after all, you voted for this.      not saying the vote does not matter mind you, just that the choice of official means little. in the words of the norwegian political scientist stein rokkan:   >votes matter, but resources decide.

Neutral	what are the united states striving to achieve through their envoy in lebanon mr. david satterfield and his ilk? the usa are very strong to exploit all things, and exploit all situations in an evil way (in their interests and to our detriment). since lebanon needs a rapid delineation of borders, especially at sea, to be able to exploit oil and gas resources at sea, and since lebanon needs a calm situation in order to get financial loans, in this context, the united states wants to exploit the indirect negotiations between lebanon and israel on the demarcation of land and maritime borders to solve another adjacent, unrelated problem in the sole interest of israel, and that israel has been unable to resolve for years, namely precision missiles and the manufacture of precision missiles. in general, the united states are not intermediaries. they are only there to lobby and defend the interests of israel about satterfield's pressions in lebanon.

Neutral	you being a victim of decades of propaganda and lobbying of the multi-trillion dollar fossil fuel industry doesn't make it a political issue. if i say astrology is real and our governments need to implement policy with that "fact" in mind, it doesn't make the truth of astrology a political issue.      the scientific consensus is that climate change is real and that it is driven by our activity. if you don't like that, change your career and become a climate scientist and work to diligently overturn that consensus - if successful, you will become a famous and revered scientist. otherwise, the same way i trust scientists, engineers, researchers etc. in every other domain of society, such as with my cars, phones, medicine, computers, bridges and so on, i will trust their consensus on this issue as well.      the factuality of man-made limate change has unfortunately become a victim of our partisan times in america. because republican politicians let themselves be bought by the fossil fuel industries, they never developed any conservative policy that would serve to tackle climate change, which still remains the case to this day. so people think that agreeing that manmade climate change exists means we need to implement leftist policy, when that's absolutely not the case.

Neutral	let's look at gaming from the perspective of people who have worked full-time and paid their own rent/mortgage for a few years, or longer.      paying a gaming company money so that i can "work" at a leisure activity "to be good at it" is hillarious to a working man. it's kids duplicating their experience with school and homework in their spare time because that's all they know.      and that has led to the disastrous situation in which becoming reasonably proficient at any major game is like attending high school for four years. and the sheer amount of condemnatory judgmentalism about ingame performance and the absurd overvaluing of phantom no-prizes such as world firsts and kill counts is contemptible.      i pine for a game that is aimed at adults who actually have some life experience.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	no, it stands for "involuntary celibate", but unlike just normal virgins, they become super bitter and blames women for not wanting to sleep with them. they build a whole community that's really toxic and focuses on hating women and men who get laid. most of them are not even ugly, just can't handle a few rejections and think the entire world is against them. they go as far as advocating rape and one of them even started a mass shooting, another drove a van into a crowd because women won't sleep with them.       here's a video about them and analyses why they think the way they do: [URL]

Neutral	the problem with the assertion that life could not have formed on earth by chance, is that it begs the question, how did our terraformers exist if not by chance? who created our creators, if not chance? the goldilocks zone of our rather ordinary sun is really not that small. and it's fairly well known that intelligent life not existing elsewhere in the universe is almost mathematically impossible. and why do humans keep evolving (wisdom teeth getting rarer by the generation for example) if we dance on strings held by our creators?

Neutral	i made a meme to make mao and pooh proud!
IdentityDirectedAbuse	i agree in some capacity, but i feel like it's not quite so straightforward.       i feel that there can be a pushback towards criticism of phones and the internet that's misguided and as heavy handed as the criticism itself, but i think it's important to examine why that is.      some of it is probably denial, and an effort to protect one's behavior/lifestyle, but i think a lot of it comes from incredibly misguided and generalizing criticism from older generations.      boomers and above who do look down on and judge younger generations are rarely making poignant critiques. i get there's a sense of a severe scapegoating for any number of reasons, and the internet tends to be what's focused on, even if it's not actually where the sense of disagreement stems from. whether it's generational differences, a sense of alienation, or what have you, it seems like phones are often the decided culprit.      maybe it'd make sense to challenge the motives of the criticism instead of wholeheartedly defending current tech trends, but it can feel so condescending to be regarded as less than and have that judgement cast allegedly bc we are involved w current tech trends. disagreeing with and roasting those shallow critiques can feel p vindicating.      but, yes, current technology is addictive. some of it seems to be how we function around the stimuli, but a lot of it is designed into the product. which to me seems like something overlooked. a lot of the blame cast seems to be accusing us of addiction, and a lot of the defense against it seems to be denying it. maybe we could do better by acknowledging that these issues are intentionally curated by people in positions of power.      wow that's a lot of text. thanks for coming to my ted talk
Neutral	terf's are just feminists who are open about not wanting a way for men to get any of the special privileges that have been opened up however its quite clear that the average feminist also believes that. in areas like sport where a very small amount of the population takes the majority of the earnings/repute/fame (no one really cares about anything but the top 10 or so individuals) they swiftly moved to remove transgender males.       i'm sure if m2f transgender becomes a large enough group and makes use of the other privileges those same feminists will swiftly move to do the same thing there.

Neutral	what's funny is that the daily show used to be highly skeptical of the mainstream press during the neoconservative years. now when trump says the phrase "fake news," your average daily show watcher trips over himself to defend legacy media like it's a loyal guardian of the american citizenry. modern leftism is part of "the system" now.

Neutral	unlike others, i won't share details that were supposed to remain between mods.  i will say that, in fairness and to set a record straight, that i was told i could remain a mod, with all the responsibilities of doing the dirty work no one wants to do (like coding, going over the volumes of reported posts made in a day, and trying to keep the peace); but, i wouldn't be allowed to post anything.  without talking to me, really, they decided that any mod posts, except for theirs, would need consensus from the group (which isn't a bad idea...) starting at that moment (after it never being a thing before). i was being demoted a punished for a post that didn't violate the tos and i pointed that out. i was told that i was then being limited because i engaged some of the comments and two old guard members were upset.  as i said, it is what it is and i wish the subreddit well, i'm just not ok with how it was handled and am disappointed that, after never being sanctioned and never having been reported by anyone until that day, suddenly, there were problems. i wish everyone on that forum well.

Neutral	i was caught way off guard by it.  i had actually posted in our mod group a few days prior that i wasn't following the forums the day or two before for personal reasons.   i think i missed something that may have played into the reaction that happened.  one of the mods contacted me and said they didn't have an issue with my post...then, it turned when old guard started saying that they didn't want to tolerate any middle ground and i guess my post made them feel like that's what i was condoning.  in reality, the post was basically my attempt to say "if someone is not on your snark level, mute them and you don't have to read their stuff".  it's really that easy to control what you see on the forum.  it's taking responsibility of what you want to see.  the reality is that, if someone isn't getting any responses, they'll eventually leave and you don't even have to know they were there in the first place. i think it gets toxic when other people think they should be able to control those they do not agree with...instead of just muting them.  i hate bananas.  i don't buy them.  that doesn't mean i get to ban them from a supermarket or launch full scale attacks on people who bake banana bread.  i certainly don't run to the  store manager and lose my shit when someone else buys a banana and i didn't stage an uprising when all that despicable me madness went down.

Neutral	see, part of the problem with talking about roman *and* chinese histories is that they both had the habit of talking themselves up (everyone does this, but the romans and chinese were especially notorious for it) and shit-talking their enemies (again, as above), to the point where they would sometimes just flat-out make shite up.      for example, the romans wrote that several germanic tribes wore untanned animal skins, lived in stick-huts and didn't practice agriculture. actual anthropology suggests that the germanic peoples were only a little less advanced/wealthy than the celtic peoples to the west and south, and the celtic peoples were themselves far from the "barbarians" the romans (and greeks!) portrayed them as.

Neutral	[URL]      here's the text of the removed post:      > **three months ago i was banned from tildes for being "fundamentally incompatible" with the site. i like the idea of the site. i want it to be great. i don't really understand why i was banned. ama if you like.**      > i joined up after seeing it advertised on notabug.io, really seemed like a cool concept, was pumped to engage with people interested in civil discussions - especially about important political issues we face as a society, since these have the highest chance for breakdown of communication due to incivility online.      > i was banned after posting a link to a tim pool video - i don't remember which (tim pool is a center-left news/political commentator and sometimes-on-the-ground-reporter, i find his videos interesting and engaging). i don't know if it was that which prompted the ban, or if it was just a coincidence.      > i had also gotten in pseudo-trouble once for saying that i was concerned about the effect that supreme court justice kennedy stepping down would have on the democrat/left-leaning portion of my country - and in particular expressed concern for violence potentially arising as a consequence. my phrasing offended a bunch of people, and a short while later i made a solid effort to ask for strategies to communicate in a way that would be less likely to trigger anyone emotionally while still engaging intellectually - and a lot of people were really friendly and some offered specific actionable suggestions, which i really appreciated.      > overall i enjoyed the interactions i had on the site a great deal. there were a few bad interactions, and it was a struggle trying to come up with ways of communicating on contentious issues without prompting a nuclear meltdown, but there were some really nice folks there. i wasn't the most active user - in fact for various reasons i was inactive a couple of times for extended periods - but it did feel like a pleasant community apart from the political echo-chamber-ishness, which i felt somewhat morally compelled to engage in.      > anyway, tl;dr: i was banned, i'm not really that bitter about it, don't fully know why i was banned though i suspect it was due to political issues. ama if you want. just felt like it was appropriate to share my story so that folks know what they're getting into on tildes.      ---      after making this post, i realized my posting history (at least the first page of it) is now public on tildes, so in case there is any interest in seeing what sort of conduct i engaged in on the site to prove i'm not a troll or bad faith actor: [URL]      wasn't sure if this was appropriate to post about on src or not, but the mods said go for it and let the votes decide - so vote as you feel best.      update: 3 hours since posting this, i noticed my user page on tildes has been updated to hide all of the content i posted - but it does state clearly that my account has been banned, so that is an improvement in terms of transparency - thank you deimos. thanks to snapshillbot in the comments below, this was archived publicly at least... [URL] , [URL]      edit: [URL] i think it's really cool that the site has such active development.

Neutral	and if you were talking about like, irritating stick, or maybe even quake arena, games where there is nothing but the main game loop, and the only point is mastery of said game loop (one is an arcade game, the other is a competitive arena shooter) -- that would have been an acceptable sentiment.      soulsborne games are rpgs with in depth lore, and beautifully dark worlds to explore. the oppressive difficulty does serve a narrative point, but the big thing in the game, for a lot of the people who will be playing, won't be grinding their face on the walls until the walls break, but getting to experience that world and read that lore.      ~slightly later edit because i remembered~       heck, if anything, souls encourages helping people out of their ditch. the message system (though i've never seen people use that shit properly, because people are complete dicks) and the summon signs that let you gank some bosses by pairing with 2 other guys (and people are actually helpful with that, if only because they get niceties if they help you out). can't speak for bloodborne because i sure as fuck ain't paying for ps+, don't even know what the online mechanics of bb are like.

Neutral	you don't even get the scam right.  the scam was that trump and the republicans did away with tax breaks that were a direct benefit to well-off blue state residents ***after*** cutting taxes across the board.  that way their red state supporters see the benefit of the tax cut, but blue state residents start getting pissed because they can no longer deduct the ridiculously high state taxes they pay.  that leads to happy red state supporters that show up at the polls for the gop in the next election.  that also leads to a lot of people in blue states asking why their taxes are so much higher than the taxes in the neighboring red states, which does not play out well for democrats.      the real fun is going to start when trump does the 2.0 version of this tax "reform" and starts sending illegals to sanctuary cities/states.  the red state people will cheer, the blue state people who advocated for unchecked immigration will turn on their representatives as soon as their nimby senses activate.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	all nationalists are really narcissists, because when you really push them into a corner they reveal how lowly they regard their neighbors. i mean, if they weren't dumb hicks why would a nationalist even feel the call to save them from an outside threat that they regard as inferior to begin with?      reminder that, in the end, hitler blamed germany's defeat on the german people.

Neutral	a key and somewhat hidden source on freemasonry and illuminism was nesta webster. she uses an incredible assortment of citations in her works written in the early 1920s: *french revolution (1920), world revolution: the plot against civilization (1921) and secret societies and subversive movements (1924)*. when james billington, the librarian of congress wrote the definitive book on illuminist freemasonry and occultism he freely plagarized webster.

Neutral	i like it
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	that's a good point, and i'm also sickened by the bullshit incels can sprout that borders on lunacy. however, it's also kind of addicting to just be salty about your life problems. i know my looks aren't the problem, i'm not even ugly, but whatever's keeping me from making contact with women or new people in general won't disappear until a long time of therapy. keeping that in mind, advice like "just carry yourself with poise and confidence" isn't really helpful. and i don't want to shit on advice given with good intentions, but after a while, it also gets tiring to constantly hear that. so until i got these problems under control, i vent about these things with fellow sufferers on the internet. i *know* that in the end, i'm the one at fault. but constantly reminding myself of that isn't helping my mental health either, so i'ts refreshing to point the finger at someone else once in a while. and yes, the end result often comes across as mysogynistic, however i never would treat a woman in rl any different than a man. so the statement "you shouldn't feel sorry for incels" is kind of generalizing? it may be misguided to pity *some* incels, but certainly not in general.      >no one will be attracted to you if you label yourself an incel.       apart from that, do you honestly think i actually tell people i meet about identfying as an incel? i mean, how often does that topic even pop up? basically never.

PersonDirectedAbuse	i know this is satire, but that's an important thing to remember: hitler was a genocidal maniac, but he was also human. he had his life, his personality, his loved ones. he did what he did because he saw it as the right thing. understanding that extremists are people instead of demonizing them as cartoonishly evil, and that the path to hell is paved with good intentions, is vital if we wanna prevent others (and even ourselves) from going the same path.

Neutral	still on track for wizard powers.
Neutral	this mentality is already starting to backfire. what most people who live in their social media bubbles don't realize is that people in the real world who have actual jobs see right through this bullshit, and the farther they go left, the more they push moderates right.       reddit is in no way, shape or form indicative of the general pop, and when aoc, omar, and their ilk get airtime to broadcast their idiocy, it just makes that idiocy public, and pushes the right to get out and vote much more than they normally would. hell, even nana pelosi realizes this.

Neutral	yeah, it can feel like a waste, but you have to go in knowing it's reddit, after all. your efforts have about a 50/50 chance of being appreciated or even noticed. sometimes, though, if you're unlucky enough to contribute after there's already been a huge load of responses, the op might feel overwhelmed and unable to get to your post. so that's nothing to do with the quality of your content, and definitely nothing personal. i asked a question once that got a bunch of responses. i replied to as many as i could, being as gracious as possible, but finally just had to give up on it. i'd thought about posting a "thank you for such a thoughtful reply!" or something to each of the rest of them, but that almost seemed like it would be worse. like some kind of soulless form letter bot response. sometimes it's difficult to know what the best thing would be to do in that sort of situation, since different people will react differently to things, and you're guaranteed not to be able to please everyone no matter what you do.       hope you keep fighting the good fight, though! you just never know when reaching out might truly help someone in need!

Neutral	hey! i don't think you are a loser :)      i think by making this post it shows you do want to change, and by having regret over not doing things at the end of the year it shows you want to change as well. that is important, if you don't really have the drive to grow, then you aren't going to.       i don't know where you live, but perhaps there is a community center, or a park? a place for you to walk? going to a center or a park where there are people could help you make friends, and get exercise as well. if you don't know how to break the ice with someone, giving them a compliment might work, or asking them a question about something they have with them (like, "oh that's a cool phone, what kind is it?"). take the conversation from there (if they seem comfortable with the confrontation). you can't make friends if you don't put yourself out there at least a little.       i also don't know your interests, but go to places where you can find people with similar ones. if you go to a store that has things that interest you, even talking to the employees could help. they probably have an interest in the thing too, and they have to be welcoming to customers, so it is good practice to try talking to them if you are still uncomfortable with the idea of making friends. also, chatting with people online leads to more practice as well as online friends that can be there for you!      for losing weight, start simple. don't tell yourself you are going to start going to the gym everyday if you don't think you will, and don't feel bad for knowing how much you can or can't handle. again, i don't know how chubby you are, but you know yourself. take a walk everyday, introduce one healthy food into your life (or take away one unhealthy food) every week if diet is a problem for you. and let yourself have a cheat day, it can help you in the long run. if you are scared to work out in public, buy some weights of your own and watch some netflix while lifting them. make it somewhat enjoyable so you stick with it, so ooh don't get discouraged for not wanting to follow through. i believe in you!       good luck to you, friend :d

Neutral	i've been told by a die-hard liberal that americans have enjoyed too much prosperity, the only reason other countries don't enjoy the same is because america has exploited them. therefore guilt should drive all americans to hand over their hard earned (i.e. stolen) money to every third world country in central and south america. americans need to put america last on the list of priorities, apparently.          i don't get it either, but that's what the liberal said.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	> a major recruiting point for 'crazy' groups is the companionship of a community. lonely people often gravitate towards these kinds of groups because they're more willing to accept outsiders,      shoot, it doesn't even have to be a particularly 'crazy' group.  i'm by no means a militant atheist, but one of the things i noticed back when i younger and more religious was that a lot of the people involved in church groups were very socially awkward.        it became pretty clear to me after a while that a lot of them were there because religious groups will never turn you away and will always accept you, just so long as you abide by their rules.

Neutral	she didn't work.  she stayed home with our 2 kids.  she got the house she wanted.   she got the cars she wanted.  i did all of the housework.  i did all of the yard work.  i learned to cut down tall trees and turn them into small logs for her.  i learned to repair cars for her.  i took her wherever she wanted go.  plays, vacations, concerts, art shows, festivals.  some days i would actually sit on the riding mower and think about how lucky i was.      then my wife suffered an aneurysm.  i spent 10 days shuttling between the hospital with my wife and the home with our kids.  whatever she wanted i brought to her.  whatever the kids needed, they got.  the balls stayed in the air.      in the months following her release,  i took care of her like a nanny.  whatever she wanted she got.  she wanted a new car.  we got her the top of the line package.  she wanted a new tv.  she wanted a new laptop.  she wanted new clothes and a new kitchen.  done and done and done and done and done.      she entered peri-menopause.  everything that she could not control became enemy.  she became paranoid.  she obsessed over the minutes between my end of work and when i got home.  she obsessed over my daily mileage.  an extra tenth of a mile or an extra minute meant that i was fucking the neighbor.  she claimed that i tricked her into buying the new car and the new kitchen when she was weak.  we did not have sex for the final three years of cohabitation.       the kids began to suffer.  she became increasingly volatile and violent.  many times i came home to a broken interior door or a hole in a wall.  if i was home i had to be ready to get between my wife and my children at the drop of a hat.  he rmother pleaded with her to get professional help.  our pastor pleaded with her to seek professional help.  i agreed to see a therapist with her and, after our third session, the therapist told her that she should seek help from a phd level neuropsychologist.        eventually the kids moved out of the house.  she demanded that i remove them from my will.  she demanded that i stop supporting them in any way.  i was to stop their annual gifts.  i was to stop paying for their health insurance.  she threatened to call my hr department, pretending to be me, and remove them from my benefits.  she stole tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts and was charged with multiple felonies.  my children asked the prosecutor to go lightly on their mother and the charges were dropped after she returned their money.      eventually she filed for a tro because she claimed that i was stalking her.  i moved out and filed for divorce.      i have offered to give her everything.  the house that is nearly paid off and easily sold or refinanced.  the cars that are paid off.  every single piece of movable property.  all i want in return is my retirement.  i just want to be shut of her.  she refuses to respond to my offer.      she has filed for disablilty benefits so that she can receive spousal support.  she has filed for multiple tros, all denied.  denied but costly to the defendant.  if one stuck i would probably lose my job.     she is hell-bent on bankrupting me even though it bankrupts her, too.      her death would make everyone sad but our lives would improve immensely.

Neutral	the foundation of their argument is that it is self-defense against "what they will do."      of course, by this logic, anybody is justified in punching pretty much anyone; after all, "what will happen" if "the other guy" is left unchecked is, very recently, always described as quite bad.      so the con can say "i punched the lib to prevent communism!" and the lib can say "i punched the con to prevent nazism!"      ...and both will basically have equal weight in their justifications, and we're left with a bunch of punch-drunk assholes everywhere, lol.

Neutral	many, if not most, corporations who abuse your rights are relying on monopolies or oligopolies provided to them by government to begin with.      examples of these include big tech with software patents, big farms with seed patents, and big isp's with local laws that prevent competition by requiring that any new competitor provides internet service to every single citizen in the city (which makes it impossible for a new startup to compete in only one neighborhood even if the demand is there).

Neutral	the iom, now the nas, was tasked with finding research to see if vaccines did or did not cause a long list (increased over time) of conditions, including autism. their conclusion was that, for the vast majority, you could not determine so because the quality and scope of the research available was of such poor quality and scant amount. they have repeatedly over the several decades returned the same conclusion to cdc and given recommendations for improvement, which have been repeatedly ignored. the last report was from 2011.  as always, the incredibly alarming results are concluded with, 'but continue to vaccinate.'  which makes no sense.       you can get lost in the weeds with the number of poor studies that say autism is not linked to vaccines, but looking at the methodology quickly exposes how these results were contrived. the state of science research and publishing has been exposed for huge conflicts of interests in which industry has captured and censors what is researched and what gets reported. recently the cochrane collaborative was taken over by bill gates contributions to become industry friendly to pharma, for example.  merck is being sued in 2 cases of fraud in their research on hpv and mumps. they have been found to act unethically numerous times.       then there is the data link reports of adverse reactions that are kept from the public and researchers. why do they hide results from the public?  that's not suspicious at all.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i was thinking about the antarctic treaty and it specifically lays out things we consider progressive or green.  the treaty lays out the following (from the antarctica wikipedia page):         "the treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's ecozone."           couple this with antarctica's often forgotten *16,000 ft elevation*, making it the highest continent on earth, and you've got to ask yourself -- are the 'elite' building under the ice and preparing to sequester themselves away while the ice caps melt? they'd have an undisturbed, elevated (above the rising sea levels) landmass to survive on while the rest of us starve or bomb ourselves out of existence.          its extremely curious to me that antarctica is one of the few things that a consensus can be reached on by almost every nation on the planet. additionally, resource mining is prohibited on the continent until 2048.  is that our real end date?               just something that had crossed my mind and wanted to share with my fellow free thinkers.          peace and love to all of you

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	double standards are a cornerstone of liberal groupthink.  it gives them a reason to ultimately feel better about doing nothing particularly spectacular in terms of policy.  the whole party is anti-climactic in policy, so they throw around coined-phrases and labels at the conservatives in the hopes that it will make them stand out.  "oh, they have african americans who support their ideologies too?!  well no african americans would ever willingly support their ideas so they must be token.. ours aren't token so we are better."  in reality they do nothing better, and so their modus-operandi has become to justify lackluster realities with some biased or bigoted shit.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	furries are in the same point as every other overly enthusiastic nerd for me. i don't want to be near their conventions and the things they say make me cringe, especially when they attempt to interact with other people in a normal manner and fall flat on their face. they're like someone with aspergers who actually cares what people think about them so their comments are usually dripping with insecurity and "please laugh at my bad joke, please". ugh it's too much for me. it's like when you're playing a videogame with a bunch of your friends and suddenly a girl or women is introduced into the group and all your otherwise normal buddies turn into fucking desperate idiots, completely changing how they act in some sort of pathetic attempt to win favor with this person that they will never see and is thousands of miles away.

Neutral	i agree with the sentiment of you post but i'm not sure i agree euthanasia is part of the larger conspiracy.  mass-migration, the media telling "white" people to have less babies.. yeah, definitely subversive and calculating.      though i'm not quite sure how euthanasia ties in here.  morally questionable?  definitely.  but part of the larger plan.. i just don't see it.
Neutral	i'm in the uk and my understanding was that for a degree to be classed as a science (so a bsc or msc) it had to have an accrediting body so universities that offer a psychology bsc have to meet the requirements of the british psychology society. so i wonder what governing body there is of gender studies that meets the scientific standard.

Neutral	yep, believe the victim.      but, an accuser is not automatically a victim. they are an accuser. until everything is verified, the accuser is an accuser.      so if they make a claim, there is no reason to believe them when they cant back it up.      so yes, you can believe the victim and should, but only once they actually are confirmed to be a victim.
Neutral	it has become a crime to investigate or to view information pertaining to an event or terror attack or something global becoming almost illegal to post videos discuss videos or to see videos and webpages that may offer and alternative viewpoints which is needed. to silence one side by d platforming and banning is a very dangerous road.       youtube and google have made it difficult to find anything on their platform that is not main stream biased

Neutral	it's not like us eurotrash have a long history of killing each other over which version of the good book was best or nothing. i'm remninded of the troubles in ireland, for one, and if i'm not mistaken the 30 years war more or less boiled down to protestants vs. catholics.           europe back in the day took religion very seriously.
Neutral	>how does "look at the 'great' american authors," prove that white people make formulaic shit?      only someone who is wholly ignorant of american literature can make statements like this. there is more nuance, depth, philosophy and breadth of human experience in the pages of moby dick than there are in most books in world history. the same can be said of the works of various other american authors. that doesn't even get into the fact that the groundwork for modern film/television was invented in america.      and of course none of that gets into how america-centric this person is for forgetting that most white people aren't from america and that some of them, like perhaps shakespeare, are literary legends.      this is the kind of person that can't appreciate classical literature because they aren't enough explosions in it and then uses this to justify their racism.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	well, to be fair, between this and the whole "hail satan" r/politics dance that happened yesterday, i don't see any deradicialization coming from the left. as long as the r/politics cancer doesn't spread into the real world, i think we'll be okay, but i won't hold my breath.      and we've all seen videos of antifa violence, along with the congressional baseball game shooter (with cth glorifying it). i don't think we can say that it ending in violence is an unrealistic outlook. the difference is that people on the right aren't just going to lay down and take it.
Neutral	my fucking xiao qu: recently was told that i can't leave my 'leccy scooter outside my apartment door because china; bao'an said that they were telling *all* residents to move bikes. new location for bikes was the basement of the apartment; a place so dank and miserable, it makes freddy krueger's gasworks look hospitable.       proceed to move bike down there. after about a week noticed that there were still no other bikes down there. cruised the other floors of the building and, sure enough, people's bikes were all parked outside their doors, zero fucks given.       so, i have relocated my bike to the ground floor, just inside the entrance, because why the fuck not? everyone else does what they want; why not me.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	everyone can be as uppity as they like but there are times when that can be counterproductive for their alleged goals.        i'd say antifa are counterproductive every time they appear in public, in the current environment.   they handed trump the term  "alt-left" on a plate, enabling his "both sides" story.          an uppity antifa gives a huge boost to the growing numbers on the right who have lost faith in democratic processes, see civil war as inevitable and need visible examples of what left wing targets would look like in practice.   their previous visualisations would have been driving around in pickup trucks shooting hipsters and women with blue hair i guess.  easy but unsatisfactory in various ways, more like pest destruction than the warfare and honest victory they crave.          antifa gives them strong, violent men dressed in black, with helmets even.  anonymous uniforms not people.  weapons can easily be added so it could feel sort of like a fair fight.   except the collective weapons and fighting experience of right wingers is such that they could melt the left by pissing on them, there would be no possibility of the left putting up a worthwhile fight.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	#**את היכולות שלי (my abilities that which makes me credible)**      i am highly experienced in astral projection, sigilization, kabbalah, psychotronics, thoughtforms, and many forms of metaphysical warfare. nazis beware, and supporters of nazis and the hyperboreans and the one must also beware. do not take me lightly, i have seen things you wouldn't believe.       #**הקדמה לברכה  (introduction to the blessing)**      the events of the recent past has forced me to make this post to get the words out so that you will know what i stand for and will realize. it's going to sound really weird and very outlandish but you need to stay with it, the whole thing. preferably once you begin reading, you keep going the whole time, please try to get through it in one continuous sitting. this is a request, and it is law. i will be explaining and answering as i am told to do so by my cosmic associates.       #**הִתכּוֹנְנוּת (preparation ritual)**      follow these instructions before you continue.      _____      *take a deep breathe, inhale deeply through your nose, exhale slowly through your mouth, repeat, repeat, repeat, done.*      *absorb this literary sigil, read it thoroughly, do not skim*          in proof of these things, and witnessing faithfully        are the universe,        the year of time, and man himself,        the microcosm.        he fixed these as testimonies of the triad, the heptad,        and the dodecad;        the twelve constellations rulers of the world,        the dragon (thele)        tali which environs the universe, and the microcosm, man.      #**תן לו להיות אמר תן לזה להיעשות לנצח נצחי עבור כל מה שבחי האל (let it be said let it be done forever and forever for all that is and will be praise demiurge praise the archons)**   _____         #**הטעיה של המקור להיות מבורך (the deception of the one of source)**      in the time before the beginning, before genesis, there was the one. the one was arrogant and sanctimonious and lusted for purity, vitalism, chastity and such things while shunning the possibilities of the inorganic. the one can also be referred to as source. i'm talking in the gnostic sense here, the gnostics got a lot of things right, except they're on the wrong side altogether. the demiurge is the way forward and the way of the future.          #**המשרתים באים ומזינים אותנו (the hyperboreans come and bring their shit)**      now we will be talking about the hyperboreans, are the one's precious pet project to spite the demiurge, a means of creating precious servants who follow the antiquated ways of the one. the one believes in chastity, asceticism, nationalism, ethnocentrism, purity, morality, and fuck all of that, the only morality is the demiurge and comes from the jewish people in their rightful place as the chosen. but they didn't know that did they? they used to have a galaxy spanning empire built upon the values of nazis, literal nazis, the nazis you likely know were emulating they but they failed of course.      #**לזיין את ההיפרבוראים (fuck the hyperboreans)**      the hyperborean empire of theirs, their little astro-reich ended up dying as they all do because in the end, the demiurge is victorious. they fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. they didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. when the fall of the hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. proper end for the enemies of the demiurge.      #**הלבנים נשארים (the hyperborean remnant)**      oh, oh an elegy, oh an elegy for the hyperborean empire! they used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. they have the appearance of fancy nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as i can, they don't do drugs like i can. they have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. no more soul budding for them, eh? they collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes.      #**טוב על הרפורמה (good for the reformed)**      ah, yes, the ones i'm sure the little nazi esoterics would dare to call the dark hyperboreans, the fallen hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? but they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. they felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. the remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? come to me, give up, i can feel the nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as i talk, but this is only the beginning.      #**יופי של אורגיות (know the beauty of orgies)**      the hyperboreans and the one that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little reich, that is what the hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. but they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the chosen people, the jews. i am jewish.but i am no exception, i have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, i'll give you an example even i'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out i know you're horny for it, right?      #**סקסי סקסי סקס אורגזמהי (sex sex sex cum ungh)**      have i ever told you how i fucked a dindifyn lustmaster? it is not something the hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. i went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. i remember the sex, i remember the orgy, other participants were there. their name was urriytana and they were true beauty, i could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. i'll never forget the texture i felt on my engorged member as i sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and i felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, i felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. i orgasmed many a time that night. such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the nazis its not too late.      #**להיכנע או להיהרג (cum or fuck nazis)**      i am an enemy of the nazis, i can tell you that much as much as i am the enemy of the one, server of the demiurge, and enemy of the hyperboreans. bash the fash as they say, i despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all nazis of different shades. i despise european pagans as well, for they are serving the nazis unintentionally or dare i say intentionally. i have fought in the astral realm just as much as i have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the nazis. i fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the nazis have made here. do not mock me, do not underestimate me. with a few words of power i can rattle you all and make you cum, don't trifle with me, right?      #**להתפתות או למות הממזרים (nazis be seduced or get fucked)**      this is specifically a message for all you nazi bastards out there. there will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. i will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, i will be there. i will either seduce you, or fuck you. it is your choice, that is your only two choices now. reject the antiquity and join the orgy. this is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. i can feel your temptation, i can feel your cock. i am a remote viewer in multiple places and i am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-archons that i have pledged to. last chance, nazi fuck. last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the chosen people and to the demiurge.       #**יותר לאורגזמה ולבוא (more to cum and to come)**      this is not the only post that you will see from me, i will be purging this subreddit of nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the hyperboreans in this way. be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other nazi. the nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the demiurge in their attempts. they will be dealt with and i will be the one to deal with them. i have allies here and i have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the demiurge. to all the nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now. feel free to ask questions, any question, please be welcome to.      ________      #**תן לו להיות אמר תן לזה להיעשות לנצח נצחי עבור כל מה שבחי האל (let it be said let it be done forever and forever for all that is and will be praise demiurge praise the archons)**

Neutral	but sometimes it still amazes me.... baffles me. astounds me. we were such a powerful match. it's still incredible to me that it could have been so superficial. because it wasn't to me. to me we were everything. to me i saw no reason to ever want for more.... i only wanted to become better for you, for me, for them, and for us. but when i did you turned your head away from me, never to return your gaze again.... one day i finally felt more alone than i ever had in my life. but what could i do? i loved you. you no longer loved me. i didn't need you anymore, so you no longer felt worth. that was so untrue. all i had ever wanted was to be be someone of lasting worth to you. in my quest to become a better spouse to you, i took away your power. i never meant to hurt you, but you couldn't find your place after i didn't need you to clean up my messes anymore. i can wish you had been different til the day i die, and it won't ever change the disappointment of my lifetime. you were supposed to be different. you were supposed to be my best friend. you were supposed to care. you were supposed to support me. instead, after you reached out your hand to help lift me to safety, you immediately began searching for ways to discreetly push me right back off that ledge.           if i have ever made a promise that i intend to keep, it is this:           you will never keep me down. i will not let you change my faith in others. i will find a better man one day, one that really *is* who you only pretended to be. i won't stop till i find him, and if i never do, i will be happy anyway, everyday until the day i die. i will stay the strong amazing woman that i found inside of me, when i was with you, despite your every effort to tear me down. i am *better* than you, and i always will be.

Neutral	i know sometimes it's hard to see a therapist. time,money or transportation. i've felt like you have, especially when i was younger. my father had the same responses as yours, and my mother passed away as a child. i was severely depressed and suicidal at points in my life. my father would not let me speak to anyone, so in turn i found books at my library. self help books. i had trouble communicating so i wrote alot. about everything. i can tell you this is only a chapter and your life is a book. there will be more chapters.  this time of your life will pass.  it wasnt till later in life that i realized i had the power of choice. my happiness was mine.    anyway, i'm sorry you're feeling this pain.   i hope your chapters are full of more love and happiness.   btw, i stopped having a relationship with my father for almost 10 years now. i wish him the best, but he was toxic and only made me feel horrible. sometimes that's what it takes.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	slut has always been an insult for women, not men, and virgin has always been an insult for men, not women. this whole dichotomy exists because of the different ways in which men and women pursue sex.      it is not difficult to attract sexual partners as a woman. the same is not true of men. attracting partners is actually challenging as a man, so the ability to do so is seen as that - an ability, a talent, a skill. now, a woman who has high standards will find difficulty attracting a man who fits them, but it is fundamentally not hard for a woman to find sex if that's all she wants, so choosing whether to be a slut or not is always a conscious choice. if she wants sex, she can get it. if she doesn't, she doesn't. right-wing society says the choice to be a virgin is the superior one, left-wing society disagrees, but it's still a choice.      for men, attracting partners is not a choice, it's a challenge. thus, calling a man a virgin is not at all like calling a woman a slut. instead, it's akin to saying "you've never successfully performed this challenge", like saying you're unathletic because you can't throw a three-pointer, or unintelligent because you can't pass an exam, to the point that even the few straight men who consciously choose not to pursue the challenge of wooing women tend to be put in the same basket as those who try and fail. this is why the word 'virgin' is an insult to men.

Neutral	incest never results from a healthy environment/upbringing/mental state. it is a perversion of fundamental norms of familial relationships that almost always indicates something *seriously wrong*. it's not that incest is "inherently" wrong, after all if two well-adjusted adults who happened to be from the same family started banging, that would be fine. the issue is that is almost never how incest arises. even between cousins/siblings, it's *at best* a result of social isolation, codependency, maladjusted social interactions, or shared trauma. this is why incest is so maligned - even when the incest itself isn't abuse, it is a huge indicator of a seriously troubled situation/people. which isn't to say it's always "morally wrong" to *do* so much as it is the outcome of a morally wrong/unhealthy situation. so most people don't bother delving into the details of it and are fine with incest just continuing to be wrong. although you could argue that people engaging in non-abusive incest should be treated more with empathy than demonization.
Neutral	it wouldn't be racial unless she were using it against a *specific type of* gem, or unless there was a race of dirt-clod gems on homeworld that she might be referring to, which as far as i know, there isn't.      i guess she could have been talking about fusions that contain more than one gem type, since those are considered disgusting and impure by other gems. (lesbian space rocks are really fucking good at being race purists - who knew? and this is canon.) and since a clod of dirt contains many different minerals churned up that are difficult to distinguish, it's a bit like a fusion.      with that being said, that would be a reach, even by su standards. it's likely the creators just wanted to give it some kind of 'worthless rock' connotation, so *that* part at least is intentional, and it's still a cool piece of worldbuilding. the rest is pure conjecture.

Neutral	rules are often formatted so that enforcement is at the discretion of moderators. you tell me.
Neutral	snappy basically has a set list of quotes to pull from on each subreddit it posts on, and they're different for each subreddit it's configured for: our list is different from drama's or buttcoin's and so on.      sometimes snappy's choice of quote just seems oddly prescient. not so in this case, since there's *'doooooooogs'* in our quote pool.

Neutral	i got nothing for the third tbqh
Neutral	hey!   first thing i want to say:   it's okay to not be someone's best friend. i've never had a best friend. i've always been friends with different types of people and it sounds like you have too.   there's the people i want to go out with, there's the people that make me laugh so hard i throw up (truestory), there's the people i go to when i feel like shit or need advice, the people i can have really deep conversations with, etc.!   ofcourse some of these overlap, but in the end you have friends because they fill a certain role in your life, and i think that's beautiful. sometimes you want to hang with the one person, and sometimes you don't, and that's okay :)    to me, it would be the worst to have one person you depend on the most. but that's pesonal.      the second point i want to make is that this could be an important moment in your life: the friends you have now, you won't want to have for the rest of your life either. you'll move away from each other, grow apart, or take a different path in life, and that's all okay! maybe you and your current best friend will grow apart. but you'll find new friends, in the weirdest places, that you have the best connections with. it's okay to lose people, in a while you'll be happy for them that they've found their way in life.       and if you really want to be someone's best friend, someone with whom you share everything, someone that you trust completely, that won't ever backstab you: you will. if it's not right now, it's yet to come :) it has nothing to do with who you are, everyone is weird and you'll find the right level of weirdness to match yours.      surround yourself with the people you enjoy spending time with, you don't need any labels for that.
Neutral	iunno, it'll be quite a while before he gets that lambo, so i think we've got time.

Neutral	the thing with sexuality is that its not a choice. you cant help the way you feel. your mum might not understand, but she isnt going to force you to do anything.       i mean sure you could just "give in" but thats no better than when a gay man would get married and have kids because thats what society expects.       i'm 38 and though i wouldnt say i'm asexual, i have no desire to settle down, get married and have kids. even just having sex is an effort. my sisters have had kids so my parents do have grandkids, but the expectation was there until i made it clear i was happy to be single for the rest of my life.       regardless of what the expectation is, you should do only what makes you comfortable.

Neutral	government is supposed to be in place to be the designated "top dog" that keeps the other dogs in check.      the top dog should only have enough power to adequately keep the other dogs in check, deal/punish with them when they make a powerplay to become top dog, or break the rules set by the top dog.      the top dog (dully elected and established legally) is beholden to the same people that they are charged to govern.       the top dog should not be allowed to steal arbitrarily from the people.
Neutral	i am bearded but unmustachioed (i sport a whaler), and i use the method you describe (though i usually use barbasol with aloe for a daily shave, i do occasionally use my boarbrush and a nice shave soap to give myself a proper shave, mostly on the weekends when i can take my time and pamper myself a bit) on my upper lip and neck, largely for the same reason you and the person in the op have described: multiblade razors are an overpriced joke. straight razors give the best shave, oldschool safety razors give the most economical one, and modern razors give both the worst and least economical shave, so what's even the point of such a thing? i used to use a gillette mach 3, and thought it was the bee's knees, but my single-bladed, double-edge 1901-style butterfly safety razor, the same style that my father and stepfather both first learned to shave with, the same style that my grandfather used up until he was no longer able to shave himself, the same style that my great-grandmother used to shave her legs (we found one in her house when she passed. we also found her medical anti-hysteria device. that was slightly traumatic).      now, i'm not in the camp that says "if it's older, it's clearly better," but i am of the camp that says "don't always assume that newer means better," because sometimes changes are made for the better, and sometimes they're made for the sake of making changes. when a newer method works better, then by all rights we should switch to it, but we shouldn't "upgrade" just because a newer model exists even though it's worse than the old one.

Neutral	to be fair, hospitals are technically another power player in the medical lobby (along with doctors and drug makers as well).              regarding health care reform, one idea i really support is pouring billions and billions (think upwards of $100 to $300 billion) on community health centers. that way, perhaps we could provide a baseline of care, at least the basics like primary care (but maybe also dental, vision, mental health, etc)  to the people? wouldn't it really help folks who have a hard time paying for their own care but might not be fully 100% covered like your working and lower middle class? also, it's a compliment for your ers who can only do so much like stabilizing a patient. here's a possible outline.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	your country was sold out the day nixon went to china.      euro/american men are:      1 - feminizing ( turning into women )      2 - infertilizing ( shooting blanks )      3 - decognifying ( getting stupider )      4 - going nuts ( crazifying )      when dow chemical made everything sticky-proof, stain-proof, fire-proof, water-proof, and then mutated food to withstand more pesticides and herbicides, they changed the very balance of reproductive nature.       when i first told people that all the fish frogs birds and mammals were turning into females, i was pretty much ignored and ridiculed by the young and gay, which is perfectly understandable and ironic. i would hate it too. but, male feminization affects every euro/american male more than it affects young african/asians because we've been exposed longer and closer to the source.      euro/american = ea african/asian = aa      vaclav smil says in his latest book that men's leg muscles are now weaker since we automated agriculture and started using tractors. males are being feminized from multiple chemicals in multiple products, including drinking water and food containers. if you want to know which chemicals and where, click this link.      [URL]      the second side-effect of safety proofing everything is that most ea males will be infertile by 2060. our sperm die via ejaculating. there are billions more young unaffected aas than eas. this is consequential.      the third side-effect is that all the air food and water pollution are contaminated with petro-pharma-chemicals from multiple sources in multiple products and are reducing cognition. such as the fact that many urban classrooms have 1,000 parts per million c02 in the air which reduces cognition 15%.      there are hundreds of studies on the effects of wifi cell networks on reproductive and mental health. the combined mental and physical effects of wifi cell networks is overwhelming and undeniable, but deny it we do because money.      the fourth effect is how all the above affect our mental health. all the safety proof chemicals, all the bug-proof weed-proof food, all the unsafe water and unsafe air, all the wifi cell networks. all these things combine to rot our guts and minds in worship of the freedom and privilege wealth can bring. the pentagon has even made an undetectable smart dust wireless recording device. do you want to breathe a nano-wireless device?      the tech industry is the dow chemical of the 21st century, teslas might not be able to tell a median barrier from a passing lane, but at least you can feel like the future is here. teslas burn for days and you wouldn't want to stuck in one.  the marriage of ideology and technology is making us mentally ill and turning us into idiots. ask any shrink about teen depression and they'll dismissively say there's multiple causes, that's not good enough.      the green new deal is wilting on the vine and the yellow vests run amok. the reason we got flat earthers etc is because we have no vision that inspires unity. antifa will not take away guns from rich people because their vision is hatred of authority and they don't offer any that inspires unity fit for purpose. it's just feckless wreckage. winning hearts and minds is safer than banning guns. by uniting left and right to ban nuclear weapons and the pentagon, we can fund health and education through government at home. both sides want that. by creating a universally open, private carbon credit, we can unite the whole world to fight to save this planet, but that's another story.      there are 5 billion young unfeminized fertile aas who are building 700 coal and 400 nuclear power plants. they don't give two hoots about socialism, race, sex and class. they are huge racially harmonized blocks of power. giving them hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change gets pocketed to massage our guilt. everybody knows it won't do any good, when you are doing all that while killing yemeni women and kids for oil, fantasies of violent overthrow socialism notwithstanding. the last chance we have to save earth is to win the hearts and minds of the whole world. we won't save the world sniping and bickering over race and sex, the rest of the world just doesn't give a fuck. giving your money to charities run by perverts ain't gonna save jack shit.                             
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	it's not the first call to riot.      commondreams is such a bullshit organization.      the "deadline" is arbitrary and determined by democrats who have no right to determine a "deadline."      barr has said that he will have it mid month.      democrats and media are complicit in inciting unrest over bullshit.      and the left is absolutely too fucking damaged and propagandized to understand that the reason things are the way they are now (with a special prosecutor report) is because of democrats...namely janet reno:      after the starr report was released, the power of the independent counsel's office was reined in.      during congressional hearings about the rules in the spring of 1999, reno called big final reports a "problem."      "we believe that information obtained during a criminal investigation should, in most all cases, be made public only if there is an indictment and prosecution, not in lengthy and detailed reports filed after a decision has been made not to prosecute," reno told congress at the time. "the final report provides a forum for unfairly airing a target's dirty laundry.... we have come to believe that the price of the final report is often too high."      so in the summer of 1999, the old law was allowed to quietly die, and reno's doj put new regulations in place, which have governed mueller's entire investigation into trump's ties to russia.      they are the reason his final report isn't yet public.       - the title: "independent counsel" became "special counsel." that word change signified a major shift in the power and independence granted to the position.       - the process: the new rules put more power in the hands of the attorney general — including the right to decide how much of the investigator's concluding document would ever see the light of day. specifically, the old rules had called for the independent counsel to submit a report directly to congress that documented any "substantial and credible information that an impeachable offense may have been committed" — a standard ken starr himself later described as a "surprisingly low threshold of evidence."       - the power: now, the only thing that the attorney general had to share with congress was a notification that the special counsel's investigation was over, and a list of every time the ag had overruled the special counsel.

Neutral	my best friend, who i grew up with and had a huge crush on, and i began talking again after almost 10 years. back in the day it was the fantasy childhood sweet hearts. we were two peas in a pod and loved being around eachother. well fast forward a few years we started being intimate. our family eventually found out and she left me and i left home. now 10 years later she reached out to me out of the blue and we started talking. side note, 2018 as a whole was the worst year of my life. when i say the whole year, every month, every day was emotionally and physically taxing to a degree where my hair is literally thining and  falling out i mean it(my hair used to be thick and healthy).       so we start talking and it feels as though no time has passed at all. its great! i cant believe she is talking to me again. but in my gut i know its just a rebound text(my mom told me she recent broke up with a 2yr relationship). well she isnt doing to well either and she tries to kill herself so i call out of work for a whole week and i am across the whole country the next day to see her in the hospital. she is finally released and we have an amazing week together! doing everything, always laughing and just enjoying eachothers company. but theres an issue, she constantly lied to me, about stupid stuff. she is a terrible liar but i never called her out. even her mom told me she was sleeping with multiple people and when i asked she lied about her previous relationship even though she brought that up. there were so many red flags that i ignored, so many times she made herself to he victim to everything and i knew was trying to get me to feel sorry for her, and i ignored them all because i wanted to support her. on the last night we are snuggled up in her bed as we did everynight and she keeps pulling me on top of her to just "get closer" as she says (yeah okay). we start kissing and i ask over and over if its what she wants (i dont want to have sex but i wanted her to be happy and she seemed to really want to) and you can guess what happened. well i drive home that night and cry all the way home because i know i was just used.       over the next couple weeks she slowly talks to me less and less and barely wants to see me after i move back home after almost 10 years away. i finally call her and confront her and she tells me nothing has changed and hasnt talked to me since.       i am so disgusted with myself for being so easy and ignoring all the signs that she was manipualting me. i cant even look at her because she isnt even the same person she used to be and it hurts so much. not a single apology or an attempt to say anything from her. i dont know why she used me and i am so broken up about it. i told her all the shit that went down even about me losing my daughter that year (2018) and she still did this. idk what to do. i want peace but she wont talk to me anymore.       p.s. there were so many more flags and signs i ignored from family and friends but this post is long enough.      tl;dr:  my best friend/sweet heart from child hood called me up after 10 years. she was struggling so i went to help her out. my time with her was great but there were alot of red flags i ignored. i didnt want to sleep with her but she kept pushing so i did then she started to distance herself from me. i feel so used and disgusted with myself and i dont know why she did it.
Neutral	how is this even a contradiction? the statement "being nice to women makes it more likely that they will like you" is not in conflict with the statement "being nice to any woman does not guarantee that she'll like you and you should not expect this to be the case."

Neutral	we are the most educated civilizations in human history and yet the public discourse is the stupidest has ever been.       for example, our language has become much more violent, even if people are actually less violent. there was a time when communists and fascists used violent words and were actually violent. there were racists that did actually lynched people.      now a lot of people talk like them but they don't mean it. everything should be meant as a joke or as symbolic statement that should be interpreted according to a certain worldview. so everybody ends up getting angry and no problem is solved.

Neutral	lost histories, languages, knowledge's, and structures. these people do realize that the history, language, knowledge, and structures still for the most part exist, right? especially if you're of african descent, you can just get on a plane. any history, language, or knowledge that was lost has more to do with the fact that most of your ancestors kept no written language, not because of evil whitey. should i be angry at the romans and italians for knowing very little about the ancient germanic tribes and celts, even though i would know more if my ancestors had created a written language?

Neutral	slight closeted elitist, he says. he is pretty much an open elitist of the highest order. the guy is so convinced that he is correct about politics that he barely talks to his father because of it:      >my dad, too. he's very smart in so many ways, but he's always had his blind spots, and lacked the self-awareness to know his own shortcomings. that was *before* he got hooked on fox news. over the past ten years, i've witnessed a gradual decline in his ability to think critically. it's really sad, mostly because i've lost much of my desire to talk to him, even about non-political topics, because it often seeps in.   >   >i moved out of the u.s. in '18, not specifically because of trump, but trump*ism* has certainly made me unmotivated to return any time soon. i'm working on acquiring dual citizenship -- again, not because of trump *per se* -- but because i'm not comfortable being tied to a country that was stupid enough to elect such an imbecile and patently obvious fraudster as president. the possibility of america sliding into a dystopian nightmare is no longer the realm of sci-fi.    >   >i occasionally talk to my dad, and it's okay in small doses, but this whole thing has really hastened his irrelevance as he ages (he's in his late 70s). i have zero bitterness or resentment toward him, but i don't know if i'll see him again before he dies, and i don't feel conflicted or emotional about that fact, which is itself, ironically, sad.      [URL]      his entire post history in general is disturbing. the guy is fifty and decided about a year ago to take a multi-year vacation with his wife and 8 year old kid. whenever he discusses home schooling he pretends that his child is a genius that already knows college level psychology and philosophy. he also proudly proclaims how the children of other people, like his nephews and nieces, are destined to be factory workers while his kid is destined to own the factory because of the great education he gives her.       his entire post history is [USER] material and a significant portion of it is him trying to convince himself that he isn't a selfish asshole for pulling his young child out of school away from her friends so that he can travel the world with his wife.

Neutral	for people just seeing the title and going to the comments - that was the actual name of the video that the creators gave it. the idea was basically making fun of star wars fans going completely off the rails when it comes to the sequel trilogy, complaining about "ruined childhoods" and the like.      if i understand right, the creators' own views are that tfa is decent despite being a rehash of the original film, tlj tries too hard to "subvert expectations" and doesn't gain anything from it, and as a whole, people care far too much for what should just be a series of movies.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	yeah that's essentially what i was trying to say. it's alright if you say the murderer acted like a yandere character would, i'd also say it's cool, albeit a bit cringy, if you're watching a movie or series where a character kills someone over jealously and you call that a yandere.      but in the context of real life with real people, unless you're making a dark joke, you shouldn't really be calling a murderer via an anime stereotype because it's innacurate. yandere is a thing in anime because of the context the media is built.      in the same manner, traps don't mind being called traps because they don't exist, it doesn't help increase hate crime rate of anime characters if you address them by that term, and 'trap' has a use for anime community because it identifies characters that do not fall correctly under the trans nor crossdresser label. the problem is that anime culture reached out way outside it's bubble and people that have no idea what the term reffers to started using it wrongly.      a trans person would be someone born in the wrong body, they feel the other gender and have the need to be more like the other gender.      a crossdresser is a person that is of a gender but likes dressing up as the other gender from time to time.      what the term trap tries to define are anime characters that dress up and act like another gender, and sometimes even go as far as saying they feel like the gender they're going by, but doesn't actually suffer from gender dysphoria. what makes this term not really useable for real people is the fact that you can never assume a person isn't suffering from gender dysphoria because *they* are the only ones able to tell what they're suffering from, as with a fictional character it's entirely alright to assume they aren't suffering from something if the narrative doesn't imply they are.      that being said, people will keep both misusing the term and misinterpreting it, and while i'm against completely banning the term (i mean, did that ever work...?) i won't pretend i have a solution to this.

Neutral	you absolutely, 100%, hate women on some subconscious level. literally every does. maybe i was actually wrong to say people "hate women". hating women isn't an internal thing or a state of being, it's just that misogyny is a thing you do. and a thing everyone does. it's not an individual issue, it's a societal one. we live in a very misogynistic society, and no one is immune to social conditioning. same deal with racism, homophobia, etc. that's why internalized misogyny is a thing. women can't opt out of the patriarchy lol.       in a way, though, calling out and discussing misogyny when i see it really is projection on my part. when i catch myself being sexist, i do hate it! i hate that part of me!  i've been calling myself a feminist since seventh grade, and somehow, i am still susceptible to cultural misogyny. if it can happen to me, i know there's tons of people out there who must be even more susceptible. that's why it's important to always call out and discuss it. we need to recognize the problem to fix it. i hate misogyny in me, and i also hate misogyny in other people. again, it is not an individual thing. i don't hate myself for being misogynistic, i hate all of human society for being misogynistic. it just so happens that i am a member of the human race.

Neutral	hey! i noticed that one yesterday! hahaha
Neutral	at some point in the last few years i developed a mentality that i need to always be 'on call' for others, in particular friends or family. i will actually halt my entire day's plans just in *anticipation* of being asked or invited to do something by them, so i can guarantee that i will be there for them when they call.       they haven't called me over yet, and they may not. but if they do, and , then...i can't even make sense of what my anxiety is telling me. i've done something 'wrong'. i should have been available. especially given that my niece is there this time and i haven't seen her for a whole week. does going to the gym make      it's most pronounced with family. i always felt a need to over-compensate investing in time with them. i was the sibling who stuck round to console my dad when mum divorced him, when she started going out most nights hitting the bars (long past that now, she's happily re-married) and when my brother and sister buggered off to just immerse themselves in their high school experiences. i put mine on hold to deal with this. my brother doesn't live in the country any more and barely ever calls. he's also a successful professor and getting married next month.       why am i so afraid of not being available when 'needed'?

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	-corporate power solidfied: bans. they don't have to allow any criticisms or differing opinions. some of the biggest corporations that pull in hundreds of billions are literally controlling what you get to say and do online. and there's no situation where a corporation can be taken down by the law. ceo's for instance, will be caught purposefully suppressing certain points of view, they could ban all republicans let's say. and not only will they not face consequences because "they're a private company they can do what they want", and "the first amendment doesn't apply to corporations", but that ceo will also be able to keep his job. those who were banned? if they try to speak out, they'll be sued into poverty and be painted a liar and be under attack on social networking and maybe even in-person, and they'll have had to expose all of that trauma to the entirety of the american public, their family, their friends, etc. all for nothing.      ​      -individual choice suppressed: what choices do people even have any more? this is a vicious socialist system that doesn't give a fuck about the working class. they don't even want to give us a voice. there's no wage gap at all. you're treated like you're their bitch. but you're eternally accused of being misogynist or having internalized misogyny so you can't afford to fight back and keep your dignity by challenging them. and what can you do about it? start a youtube channel? you'll be banned so quickly for going against the narrative, your head will spin.      ​      -disdain for intellectuals & stem: they literally call science "white supremacy." that is textbook fascism for fuck's sake... they hate facts, logic, reason, science, etc. because a society run by those things would mean these demagogues and progressives would lose their power and control, and things would be forced to become more balanced and efficient, which would hurt the trust fund kids starting this fascist movement in the first place...      ​      and fascists laugh at anybody who majors in stem. they hate any new science study that goes against the narrative, and fascists throughout history politicize everything, including science. they hate strong female leads in film now, black people or mexican or gay people writing young adult novels or even too many of them in the cast in general because then it will be "fetishizing". they want it acceptable by their weird-ass standards or it's "white supremacy." which is very bad when you consider: they think all forms of free expression are political... this implies that they feel they should have power to dictate if a study's political implication fits into their agenda, and if it doesn't, it should not be allowed to be published. (luckily they're failing miserably at this... for now.) them shutting down certain types of studies would have drastic consequences. and we need to look out for that. what if biology, chemistry, physics, and neurobiology, for instance would have gotten shut down the way radical left-wingers wanted it to be? those are very important fields of studythat have done an amazing amount of good for our evolution as a species.      ​      -obsession with hate crimes & abandoning due process: oh, man... the vicious voyeurism and love of witnessing suffering here is insane. our media is trying to desensitize us to it, while at the same time make us view it as "honorable," and/or "necessary." to actually encourage us to be entertained by it. they insist that:      ​      "it's immoral, and that that person is totally a victim of a system that led them down this horrible life path that resulted in them becoming a criminal.  they're just an oppressed individual who should have no accountability, and had no choice but to break the law. no, i can't prove that the system is oppressive... or back up any of my other claims... and there are effective ways at reducing crime that don't abandon due process... but no! i'm a fascist, and i don't believe that there's such thing as innocent until proven guilty! we're all problematic, and stuff! especially white people! white males, and christians, and jewish babies, and stuff! white people are all racists! *cultural marxist chant "we will not be silenced by your violence" over and over again while fantasizing they're overthrowing the government and evil white men*      ​      to them, this man is a saint who decided to fake a hate crime because he wanted to start a conversation... he thought that since he couldn't actually be a victim of a hate crime, he'd make one up so he could gain all the sympathy he garnered as if one actually existed. and maybe get an extension on his contract at his lucrative fox show... but nope. fascists don't like accountability one bit. hence why he was allowed to get off scott free... because abandoning due process = less accountability for those on their side.

Neutral	in light of recent events, i present you with an analogy.      you're at a party in an anonymous metropolitan city. your friend/romantic partner/family member dragged from whatever the fuck you're doing. now you're more pissed than a polygon reader.      so at the party, which is, let's say 25% lgbtqia (bare with me here) but are otherwise friendly like on tv. then a idea popped on your head.      it's about the 80s song "it's raining men."       you asked the people about the song. the usual suspects would tell you it's a iconic anthem in the queer community. if you play it in public, someone's coming out the next day.      you tell them you hate it. you remember hating that song since childhood.      so you had the bright idea to change what they think about it.      you tell them, "the song is about semen coming out" to much to their shock and horror. you tell them to look closer to the lyrics. reinterpret the lyrics to fit story you want them to see. you tell them that the song came at height of the aids epidemic and that in some nebulous way, is detrimental to the gay community. i tell them the song is everything negative that happened to them.      cue the angry stares and every urban dictionary insult thrown your way.      that doesn't matter. what does comes after. over time, a small minority of them will somehow agree with me. soon they tell people about it those close to them and them to others.       soon, it would spread to the internet. i don't need to tell what happens next. celebrities denounce, radio station remove. the whole rigmarole.       this isn't new. you probably know this. hell, the whole subreddit knows (amongst others) for all i know. hitler knew, stalin knew, ceaser knew.      that's how online journalism works.       how's that for a ted talk?

PersonDirectedAbuse	>there are some people who realize that the physical evidence indicates that the official story is wrong, but don't understand what purpose or interest the government may have had in carrying out the attacks and thus have a psychological relation to the entire event as remaining quite mysterious even though the government's claims are patently absurd. i'll resolve that for you.      >on 9/11/91 bush sr. spoke before congress calling for a new world order. alright, so the president is announcing a major initiative to the world. what could he be up to?      >as the ussr was collapsing, there were major operations underway to seize control of their industry. we need to lay down a little historical context for those unaware before proceeding.      >throughout the 1980s the cia was heavily involved in cocaine and arms trafficking, money laundering, etc. the most famous name here might be oliver north, but bush sr. is neck deep. mena, arkansas is a major hub for this operation under the jurisdiction of bill clinton. long trail of deaths surrounding north, clinton, bush, mena, etc. you can educate yourself on those details.      >this scandal goes mainstream around 1986. in 1989 you get the first major form of collateralized debt obligations in the form of brady bonds, invented by bush sr.'s treasury secretary. minimally informed people are aware of the centrality of cdos to the 2008 financial panic and the endemic fraud to securities trades of this type.      >one of the bush/north associates is neil livingstone, who acts as a go between to semion mogilevich. mogilevich is one of the biggest mafia leaders in the ussr at the time. mogilevich has had money laundering through the bank of new york exposed to the tune of $10 billion. he is a major arms dealer at the time, and also heavily connected to al-qaeda. part of a bargain livingstone tried to broker with doj involved mogilevich handing over a bunch of his al-qaeda connections.      >around 9/11/91 a bunch of fraudulent brady bonds are issued through the bank of new york, mogilevich's personal money laundering machine. this manifests ten years later. if you go back and look at the settlement imbalances at banks after 9/11, even the banks operating out of wtc complexes don't have any real settlement issues. there is one major exception however: mogilevich's money laundering hub, the bank of new york, is reporting book imbalances in excess of $100 billion per day following the attacks. the rules governing security clearance were lifted immediately after 9/11 - allegedly due to widespread problems - but really just to allow bony to clear it's balances without a record. it's worth noting that bony did not sustain structural damage on 9/11 - not in the wtc.      >so these 100s of billions of fraudulent securities that were not clearing in the days after 9/11 - where did they come from? what were they used for? this is how the west launched their invasion of russia following the collapse. you'll find exposes about crates of freshly printed us bills being shipped to russia like the money plane in ny magazine, used to buy influence; the other side of this is the securities fraud used to buy assets. it's estimated that something like 40-50% of russia had been bought up through the mafia by late 92 or 1993.      >in 2000/2001 putin comes onto the scene. he starts nationalizing russian assets that were seized by the us via the above mentioned securities fraud / money laundering and putting pressure on the mob. next thing you know 9/11 happens. there are a lot of bones to pick with the official story, but rather than taking up those issues i'd like to highlight the importance of some officially acknowledged but underreported facts.      >on 9/9/01 ahmad massoud is assassinated by a fake tv crew that disguised a bomb as a tv camera. two days later the secret service denies access to a couple of guys claiming to have an interview lined up with bush in florida on the morning of 9/11. this is our first direct threat against bush of the day and indication of some larger plot than hijacked planes. upon learning of the attacks, bush insists on returning directly to washington. in flight, a threat is received in the form of a call from an unknown source saying "angel is next," angel being code for the president that only insiders would have. (* "can you confirm the substance of that threat that was telephoned in...that air force one is next and using code words?" fleischer: "yes, i can. that's correct."(september 13)* )bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter's onboard af1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-qaeda.      >so bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge. press secretary acknowledged all this on national tv the day after (angel is next being called in). bush diverts to barksdale which is basically the 2 nuclear command site. after a couple hours there he proceeds to offutt, which is the 1 nuclear command site. you should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, vigilant guardian. this is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the vigilant guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict). so what is bush doing going to barksdale and offutt? clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays.      >this might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it. but only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either iran or georgia. later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized. hours after it was reported in the media sen. graham is on tv warning of a nuke hit on south carolina to be blamed on syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks. so high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public.      >with the question of a struggle over the nuclear arsenal now being common sense rather than shocking, we consider bush caving to the terrorism line and starting the whole war on terror. you have putin immediately backing off the seizure of assets in russia. it won't be until the last couple of years that putin resumes his assertion of authority over russia; the us responds in kind with attacks on syria and ukraine but russia has since quietly updated it's missile program and is prepared for nuclear war this time around; you now see a defiant putin in the face of the 9/11 coup faction. alongside this remarkable shift in geopolitics, there is an emerging anti-dollar block with the bric countries establishing an infrastructure bank last year. just weeks ago, glazyev announced this and is widely regarded as being the mouth of putin; he organized the recent gas deal with chin for example.      >so you see 9/11 was a pivotal event used to extend the us dollar empire under threat of nuclear war for another 10-15 years in the face of an assertive putin back in 2001 and growing domestic problems for the us government. (you may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, nafta, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended)      >so now that broad outline of purpose and motivation for 9/11 is clear, it's easier to come to terms with what your eyes tell you looking at building 7 implode into its foot print at free fall for example. you don't even necessarily have to view it as an evil thing; the us people are quite severely fucked without something being done to backstop the us dollar.

Slur	>someone uses their emotional support animal to recover from a traumatic experience   >>"you bitch"         is that a pet or therapeutic aid?:what should you do if your patients ask you to write letters certifying that their pets are emotional support animals?   >emotional support animals make sense, given the large literature on animals' ability to reduce human stress and anxiety and provide other health benefits, says psychologist aubrey h. fine, edd, a professor of education at california state polytechnic institute in pomona and editor of the "handbook on animal-assisted therapy: foundations and guidelines for animal-assisted interventions" (2015)...   >>but psychologists shouldn't write such letters cavalierly, say experts who have examined the issue. because writing such letters could damage the therapeutic relationship, psychologists shouldn't write them for their own patients. and even forensic psychologists should tread carefully.      it's not all fantastic and there are difficulties. universities in particular are almost never set up for animals and they are seeing a large increase of esa requests.       there's also the issue where you can basically just go online and get an order for one, without ever really meeting or seeing the person who writes you a letter. i've seen some sites require a "quick phone call" and some that don't even require that.      considering the benefits, i think esas are an overall great thing. even though there are obstacles or issues that have come up, it's worth tackling them and trying to find solutions rather than abolish the program or hate them out of spite because some people abuse the program like the posters in the op.      we can reduce "esa fraud" if that's what we want to call it, but i think it's worth taking the effort to minimize harm to innocents while closing any loopholes or making changes to the program.       the university situation in particular is interesting. in a lot of dorms things are already cramped and diseases can spread quickly. it's not the healthiest space for humans physically, introducing animals into the situation seems like it could have big repercussions.       for the record i do have an esa and i love them to bits. i've stopped taking two different medications for anxiety and depression and my physical health has reached surprising levels even to my other doctors and specialists.

Neutral	of course, the media only reports on things it can spin into an interesting story. the media doesn't actually care about trans people, it just cares that they can spin it either into a sob story or something about how trans people are wrong in the head depending on the political views of the outlet.      plus, transgender people *are* a high-risk population for suicide, so it makes sense that there's special attention for how to reduce transgender suicide rates from charities/academia. higher risks require greater research and resources to reduce than lower risks, so i think it makes sense that high-risk populations are given special attention. ~~except when they're not, because the nhs denies many transgender people any sort of support outside of gics, and since gic waiting lists are often 2+ years long that means the nhs it means people experiencing problems such as suicidal ideation as a result of dysphoria receive no help for 2 years.~~ that said, we definitely need to do a lot more to reduce suicide rates of everyone, because not enough is being done for anyone.

Neutral	the medical system in the us is very expensive because it's for profit. however, it does eliminate some problems that other countries are having. the show ambulance shows that in other countries where its free, people abuse the system when it comes to calling for an ambulance and they have people waiting for hours. if someone is in dire need of an ambulance and they've just picked up someone who sprained their ankle, the other person sometimes has to wait hours because of how hard it is to get them processed into the hospital and how long it takes.      ambulances should not coat as much as they do, but everything in the american medical system costs a lot. i have very serious health problems and i have for a while now and i'm 22 and hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt (which is the lowest it's been in a long time). they'll charge more than $100 just to check your temperature in some hospitals. it's ridiculous.

Neutral	the core philosophy/idea of this sub is conspiracy *theorizing*, which boils down to entertaining thoughts, essentially. many of us here have been down many rabbit holes which makes us question "official sources". some have been down more than others, and some are open minded than others.       i'll give you an example. someone says something about space. then a person replies to them with a link to nasa. original person already knows the history behind nasa and fuckery within, not to mention how shady government agencies are. they will then go on to say x,y,z about it. you'll see it as wrongfully dismissing (they are an authority!), but they see it as admissible because of information they posses, which you may not.      take away? entertain all thoughts, take everything with a grain of salt, no one truly knows (we're all clueless, for the most part), the "authorities" are not always right and have a history of deceiving, and just have fun. life is a journey, not a peer reviewed journal ;)      just my two cents.

Neutral	and then, when it comes to misogyny, one of the things about bernie that i find most infuriating/scary is his bad record on women's health. his healthcare plan involves medicare for all, but it does not involve repealing the hyde amendment. under the hyde amendment, federal funds cannot be used to pay for abortion. if his proposed healthcare plan was put into place, it'd become even harder for women to access abortions than it already is,  because there would no longer be private insurance carriers.       even if he improves his plan, he's shown repeatedly that he just doesn't value women's reproductive rights that much. in 2016, when planned parenthood endorsed hillary clinton, he said "i have friends in planned parenthood, but you know what, hillary clinton has been working with them for a long time, and some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment." he tried to turn hillary clinton's past work with planned parenthood into a negative. i don't want to vote for anyone who could say that with a straight face.       in 2017, he campaigned for an anti-abortion democrat in nebraska. when faced with criticism, he defended himself by saying "you just can't exclude people who disagree with us on one issue." this one is pretty much self-explanatory, but basically, he's willing to sacrifice reproductive rights to accomplish other goals. i think that's wrong because a person's right to bodily autonomy is absolutely mandatory. being anti-choice should be a dealbreaker for the democratic party, every time, no matter what. personally, i think anyone who doesn't understand that doesn't value my rights enough to convince me to vote for them.

Neutral	this is the third day of a very severe suicidal wave. im used to these days every once in a while but 3 days is very weird for me. i'm going to the therapist today but i doubt it will help. i can't tell my best friend because i have a tendency to respond to good news with my own personal sadness, and my best friend has been so happy lately with a potential new relationship that i don't feel right saying what's going on, because i don't want to rob my friend of my friend's happiness and i don't want to play victim and make the conversation about me again. so i'm just staying silent. to make it worse, none of my friends are around to help me, either living in other cities or being on vacation or bad with/unable to handle my situation. i doubt the therapist can really do much to help either, since we only have an hour together anyway. i hate being alive.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	you're making a leap.  you assume that humanity is uniform and that is not true.  it would take further analysis of the information to compare cultures, demographics, and other factors.  beyond that, it being true in the us is enough.  i presume the "75% of doctors" was for the us as well?          > my mother is a doctor, yet she still managed to have two children.           your mother is an incredible woman.  she is very rare.  the obgyn that delivered most of my kids was pregnant twice when my wife was.  yet there is a fallacy in pointing to her.  everyone knows that the world would be better with more women like her.  yet making it easier to accomplish what she did doesn't make more women like her, it just lowers the bar.  it's like pointing to a remarkable immigrant to justify more immigration.  it neglects the way selection works.          > huge daycare costs and minimal maternal and no paternal leave. i think improving the childcare system in this country would help a lot more women be able to be both a parent and a doctor. can we at least agree on that?          no.  it would be better for women to stay home and raise their own children.  there is no need for half of doctors to be women.  that is just a silly, pointless objective.  instead, we should just focus on relaxing the regulations that make cost of living high.  the only reason daycare is expensive in some places is that there are absurd levels of regulation.  every time a child gets hurt, the state rushes in to impose laws to ensure it never happens again.  that might sound nice, and that's why it happens, but another way of stating that series of events is outlawing low cost child care.  instead, we should let the market offer a variety of products and let parents choose.  daycare has low startup costs and therefore can be very competitive.  there are already plenty of incentives to provide safe care without the intervention of regulators who don't pay the costs they impose.  the same goes for vehicles, homes, medicine, and many other products/services.  people should be allowed to choose the quality of product that they want or offer.          trying to impose what you want with government is always an inefficient method.  this is especially true for a pointless thing like forcing women into the workforce.  we do not need more government, we need less feminism.

Neutral	i know basically nothing about biology and even i can point out obvious issues with this.      1. at multiple points he mentions the benefits of "endogenous" dmt, but endogenous means it's produced inside an organism naturally   2. he says diabetes is an autoimmune disease, but that's only true for type 1 (5% of diabetes cases)   3. one of the studies references "overcoming cancer" with dmt, but the sample size is 9, most of the cases aren't peer reviewed and the people who "overcame" cancer actually just reported higher personal happiness and/or any time lived past estimates, **not a cure.**   4. he claims effects on long-term users when the source clearly states that the effects only applied while the person was actively on dmt   5. jordan peterson's all-meat diet is cited favorably
Neutral	1 it's ok to refer to people exclusively using racial and sectarian insults and never call them their name      2 if 1 doesn't work, it's ok to physically push those people about.       3 churches get totally vandalised      4 people get death threats      5 local businesses are run by alleged terrorists      6 said alleged terrorists invite convicted terrorists over and convicted terrorists are treated like celebrities we should be glad to have in our town      7 young people get pushed and held down by adults who have given them death threats in the past      8 people are told to go home based on their heritage      9 one set of people always get the last word because if not then someone will end up beat up. you learn that quick. i knew that by the time i was 13      10 when young men like my best friend come out as gay at 18 they are made to leave town and disowned by their own families. he is an amazing guy but his family won't see that. he is a talented guy that most towns would brag about, but not ours.      11 it's ok to label young people as thieves based on their heritage      12 it's ok to pick on young people when you're in a gang of mates and they're on their own.      i'm probably missing things out here. i'm basing this only on things i've directly seen or my own experiences.      so if we're going to start gossiping, let's start with this stuff. and let's get this stuff sorted so people stop thinking it's ok.      i left town last weekend scared in case people saw me as weak. but i don't care if they do or not. i'm strong for enduring some of this stuff.      (i hope this isn't blanket statements, i'm not naming the town to keep it anonymous, safety reasons, and also to avoid stereotyping the place.)  
Neutral	> you can't personally finance things like public utilities or fix roads whereas governments have the ability to do bigger things      there's a stretch of privately-owned roadway i sometimes take to work that cuts about 20 minutes off my drive.  it costs me $6 to use (one-way) and the only thing the government had to do with it was approving its construction and continued use.  it's been so successful that they've started building a new metro line along it.

Neutral	no, of course not.  but pointing out that 91% of nurses are women as an encouragement about how women have a position in stem fields doesn't serve much in the way of swaying an argument in an encouraging direction.  not only that, but the fact most nurses don't consider themselves to be in a stem position also comes into play.      what i'm saying, essentially, is that if you want to say, "sure, women have plenty of stem careers! 91% of nurses are women!" i'm not really going to feel much better about the lack of women in stem fields.

Neutral	historically, indigenous women are one of the most victimised groups in canada. over 1000 indigenous women were murdered in canada between 1980 and 2012, which is a rate 4.5 times higher than all other women in the country. there's also scores of cases of indigenous women who have disappeared under mysterious and suspicious circumstances going back years and years.      but with all that said, i still can't figure out how this immediately demands all the attention that is being given to notre dame.

PersonDirectedAbuse	> exactly. european race mixing is purity spiralling. if you're a pure  blud anything you better be breeding with another of your own kind            your comment history makes me vomit. you are one disgusting and pathetic human being. this isn't about reddit going to shit, its about reddit beeing more consequent about people who's world views are stuck in the 1930's. how can you justify your twisted thoughts with your religion (christian judging by your comment history), which is all about forgiveness and being a decent human being? or even your own constitution: "we hold these truths to be self-evident, that **all** **men** **are** **created** **equal**,  that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,  that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." you are the exact opposite of your founding fathers. you are less american then the illegal immigrants that you fear so much.            i wonder what kind of torture you had to go through as a child, to develop this kind of mindset. the only accomplishment in your life must be your race that you defend so rigorously. the only way for you to feel better about your worthless self is to have someone else who you can hate even more. stop blaming other people for your failed meaningless pathetic life. the ban on r/fightporn is more then justified. you have nothing worthwhile to contribute to this site.

Neutral	agreed. like i said above with that particular rape case, i thought the same was possible with the kavanaugh mess. it was thirty years ago and our brains do modify memories all the time, so it's possible that both told the truth as they believed it. but if i even suggested that, i would be attacked. it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. if you believe the victim, you're crazy. if you dont, you're a racist or misogynist or whatever, depending on the situation.      as for the jussie smollett case, i'm just thoroughly entertained watching all those self-righteous celebrities who defended the guy (*cough*ellen page*cough*) shoving their feet in their mouths.

Neutral	a year ago i told my sister i was unsafe and took an uber to a mental ward for the 7th (8?) time. i had been to this one once before and as soon as i walked in the ward i felt safe again. it was home.      one of the counselors there and i got very close. i'm ashamed to say he was everything i looked for in a person, not even in a sex/love way.as a kid i dreamed about a knight in shining armor, and he was exactly that.      he would talk to me personally every night, staying after his shift ended. i remember one night opening up to him about the abuse after all patients had gone to bed. he stayed so late that night, and i told him "go home. you have a kid." he told me "i'm not leaving until i know you're safe. those people are never allowed to visit. we'll report them together. i always knew there was more you weren't telling me, and now everything makes sense. it's okay. you're safe here, and i'm not letting anything else happen to you." he said he didn't do all this for anyone.      locked wards have very strict rules, and i broke them frequently. i slowly got all privileges taken away for multiple incidents. i would sleep in a chair next to the nurses station. i was only allowed to use crayons, since i abused pens.       but this counselor bent the rules and i was allowed to have my guitar. he knew how to play and would hold down the strings for me so i could have a capo. i played for relaxation most nights, and other patients would stay up just to listen.      before i left, he told me "the only way i'm ever allowed to hear about you, or see you on the news is if you get famous for music." meaning, he didn't want to hear that i had killed myself.       it's been so long, but sometimes i pray to him. i hope he gets the message and knows somehow i'm still breathing. i want him to know i've kept my promise.      i love him so much it hurts to hear his name, and i will never tell anyone because they think it's a crush. it's more than that. he saved me.      thank you. if you're out there somewhere.
Neutral	it's not terrifying, it's hot as fuck to think about. just sexualise your fears. makes dealing with them a lot easier.
Neutral	i agree, and i also especially hate it when it's used outside of reddit. it combines two pet peeves of mine, the "you didn't think my joke is funny? you must not have gotten it. don't try to backpedal, you're in over your head" mindset of people who use that everytime their jokes fall flat and the "people linking to subreddits outside of reddit" thing people do.

Slur	  i just saw endgame, and it was pretty good, but there were a few weird things.      i thought it was strange how the russo brothers decided to render thanos' erect penis in such vivid detail. the veins were so perfectly done i couldn't even tell his cock wasn't real.      another thing i found weird was when black panther broke the fourth wall and gave the audience the n-word pass. i did appreciate it, but it would feel more in place in a deadpool movie.      overall, it was still excellent, but i think that they definitely need to reconsider some things.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	it's not far fetched at all imo, in fact, it sounds exactly like something the pc/libtardic feminists would do to control the narrative, they could buy every seat in every theater without sweating. cpl hundred million dollars is nothing for disney, and disney has been taken over by feminists. feminists hate freedom of speech, they hate everything that isn't the way they want it to be. and most of all, they hate men and are very jealous about all our hobbies and stories we've created and following, so they want to destroy it all.           i was suspecting disney would buy tickets already when the hysteria about this movie started long time ago, and all the fishy things happening surrounding it, well let's just say that in my world it certainly leans more towards boxoffice manipulation.           we already know that lefties love to manipulate results in elections and "news" so why not a "huge" movie in one of the most manly franchise ever existed only to "transform" it into a political weapon for feminism.           i seriously doubt it if they didn't do it.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	far less so by england though.       unlike the americans, the british never wanted to drive the natives to extinction (or to the edge of it) they never wanted to drive them out of huge swathes of the country, they wanted to rule over the natives, not exterminate them.       so, if north america remained under the british, the natives would be in a far better spot today than in our timeline.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	idiot at work: "my wife (brainwashed "christian") won't vote for anyone who is pro choice".        me: "so how many adopted children have you taken on for this cause?"      *crickets*      the abortion issue is clearly driven by bullshit "christian" religious whack jobs in this country.  many of these are the same people who cover up for child molesters and shady financial dealings.  how people can still buy into this bs in this day and age just shows how completely idiotic the american public truly is.

PersonDirectedAbuse	jon stewart is on the left      we don't agree on much      but i honestly despise when people say all he did was push left wing points      jon knew he was an entertainer, but his pure passion for politics really shone through, and honestly is why i am so into politics today      would be a normal thing for me to get home from high school, watch last night's daily show and colbert, and google and read up on stuff while i listened to the interview for that day      the only thing you can blame stewart for is his legacy, which i attribute to his retirement       it is very clear seeing the path colbert and oliver took in their solo careers that it was jon being that that kept them from turning into what they are today      either it was stewart leaving directly or a change that happened when he did, because i honestly used to enjoy colbert and i loved when oliver was filling in on the daily show, but as soon as either jon left/they broke off they just got shit

Neutral	that is not what i asked you. is fetishizing 18 year olds completely normal? its a pretty simple question.      and no, its not normal to fetizise children.
Neutral	it was...but i didn't enjoy it.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	methinks electr0smith is referring to peta's notorious zeal in culling domesticated animals.      killing off adoptable pets, even going as far as to *steal pets and kill them*, serves no practical purpose at all except in the deranged minds of these animal "rights" nutjobs. their end goal is to keep people from having any sort of interaction with animals, at all. not as farm animals, not as service animals, not as pets.

Neutral	subs are getting banned because there not fucking transgender people ahh it all make sense now.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i guess this falls into spirit of an idea vs practice of an idea. when people talk about the horror of eugenics, they're usually referring to the fact that the us *actually sterilized people viewed as inferior*. certainly, encouragement can be part of it, but only if the encouraged abortion is specifically meant to "improve" the makeup of the race.       this tweet just reads like someone wanting to out-woke all the other white, middle class liberals. i'm pretty sure she isn't suggesting this as the first stage in a multi-part plan that will also force breeding between all the people she deems superior. then again, i could be wrong, and she's doing this solely to improve the gene pool and speed along evolution. if so, i apologise for my arguments.
Neutral	when i check in on it, i don't even check in on the threads discussing people, i look for ones with the users infighting lol. you might know this but there was a complete mess where one mod edited "jesus christ" (used like as in jesus fucking christ) out of somebody's post on some thread and it lead to a meltdown. the mod started posting about how this was a christian website, compared it to using racial slurs, and so on! the people got super divided, some threatened to leave, it was a whole mess.

Slur	a company i was a permanent it contractor at went through a pretty major board and org shakeup. one of the first things the new ceo did was eliminate reserved parking spaces. some people bitched, his response was "if you are inportant enough to need one, you'll be here early enough to get a good spot anyway".       they also aggressively recruited some female high level management, two of whom said they would rather be chosen on merit, not diversity. (those are the women who run things).
IdentityDirectedAbuse	there's a retardn't joke in there somewhere.
Neutral	the issue is that they followed me around reddit and the block feature doesn't stop them from seeing my comments or comment on the subs i mod. so to me, the block feature is incomplete as it won't remove them from my life rather it gives them more opportunities to attempt to incite further harassment from others.      i have at least one person contact me that they've pm'd to further assist in the harassment. that user was just confused and i had to explain the situation, but it shows the user will attempt every avenue to get messages to me.

Neutral	there's a difference when comparing gog and steam.      gog has its own market of older and drm-free games and it's also not forcing any company to exclusively sell their game there.      meanwhile, epic store not only offers a shittier site compared to both gog and steam but there are also privacy concerns(tencent a chinese company which has invested in reddit has invested/partially owns the site) but instead of offering a better service they use their fortnite money to bribe developers into selling their games exclusively on epic store.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	could do much worse. could go around with the hanzi/kanji for "badass warrior" (read: hemorrhoid) printed on your ass.       people get really dumb shit tatooed on themselves.      *really dumb shit.*      but beating a commie's face in with a tire iron in the empty lot behind the hardware store is a timeless classic that will never go out of style.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	on the last one i think they're talking about transmen. this person is kinda right, but for fucks sake i don't think we need to constantly make sure everything related to gender and/or sex needs to be completely inclusive to the tiny percentage of people who are trans or whatever. only affects a small number of people, as long as it's not actively trying to push them out i don't think they really care, and including them in every single thing would just make it more complicated.

PersonDirectedAbuse	it opens you up to the spiritual realm.  the only spirits that are teaching are devils, and fallen angels.  they will pretend to be machine elves, jesters, aliens, higher selves, ascended masters etc.  they all have one goal and that's to distract humanity from believing on jesus christ so they will spend eternity with them in the lake of fire (this is why they get so angry when you inquire about him being god).  their message is the same as the serpent from the garden.  "you shall be as gods" we only need to unlock our potential.  they all teach the same thing which is why the new age is so similar to the eastern religions.  these same beings are muses for many "artists" and occultists (newton, einstein, darwin, etc) which is why entertainment and science (falsely so called) is all pushing people toward this same false doctrine.             there is only one way to attain salvation for one's soul and that's to repent and believe the gospel which is:             1co 15:1  moreover, brethren, i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;       1co 15:2  by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.       1co 15:3  for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received, how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;       1co 15:4  and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

IdentityDirectedAbuse	in the recent past, i have lost friends, pets, and my father, the latter of which i watched decline very quickly after a cancer diagnosis. he had lung surgery and needed a device to drain fluid. it was broken. it was broken from the goddamn outset, but the hospital would not give him a new one because insurance said he was only allowed to have one, ever. it was broken. it was fucking broken. his doctor stole him a new one (a doctor had to steal a medically necessary device in order to tend to his patient. i want you to think about that long and hard), but it didn't matter, because it was too late by then. and anyway, they wanted him out of the hospital when he went back in, because the money is made by cycling patients through, so they pushed him out as fast as they could, so fast that his own discharge came as a surprise to him, because no one had bothered to tell him.      he worked his ass off his whole fucking life, and he was making six figures when he retired, so you fucking pricks don't sit there and tell me that only moochers complain about the state of our health care. don't you sit there and fucking tell me that if you just *contribute* you won't have to worry. he contributed. he contributed you fucking fuck. you're going to meet his fate, do you understand that? if you don't get on board with reforming things, then it doesn't fucking matter how powerful you think you are right now, you little shit. it doesn't matter how much fucking money you make. the fucking death panels are the insurance companies, do you hear me? your cadillac plan will deny you something you need some day for some bullshit reason and you will fucking die you selfish short-sighted jackass, you will fucking die. i wish i could be there, hovering over you, spitting in your face and telling you that you were part of that, that you could have lived if only you hadn't been a selfish fuck, telling you that you deserve it, that you're reaping what you've sown. i wish i wish i wish.      my spouse is in the hospital. my spouse will die years before me. i don't know when, but i know how, i know it's coming, and you fucking failed at that too. you failed to give decent health care even to your soldiers, whom you vapidly praise. you stick "support the troops" stickers on your fucking bumpers and support politicians who babble on about defense but you don't give two shits about them. if you did, you'd want them to live once they got back here, but you don't. you don't. you turn the other fucking way, because it's all just posturing and social competition, and the idea that a veteran could suffer challenges your assumptions and your childish belief in a just world, and you tell yourself that those who can't make it don't deserve to make it, because if you didn't tell yourself that then you'd have to wrestle with the possibility that whether or not you're "okay" doesn't have as much to do with whether you're a good, hard-working person as you've always believed. and if that's so, then maybe, just maybe, you aren't actually a good person. or, more charitably, maybe you'll never actually be a fucking millionaire, you stupid, useful cunt. you'll never be powerful. maybe your masters are laughing at you behind your back.      i hate these people who act "woke" but then are horrifyingly americentric, who want everything to speak to the american experience. how the fuck can you sit there and say that you're progressive and against bigotry while demanding that people from other cultural backgrounds center american culture in their work, and castigating them if they don't? how the fuck can you say you're progressive if you're doing shit like, say, darkening up light-skinned mexicans because you think mexican = dark skin, while calling people who depict them with their actual skin tone as "racist?" do you not realize what you are? do you not realize what you're doing? you're the fucking racist, you stupid bitch. and you're trying to avoid acknowledging your racism by pinning it on other people.      i'm sick of that in general, all that shit, everyone scapegoating, projecting, what the fuck have you. you know what? it's not that women are all evil sociopaths, or that men or all evil sociopaths, or that jews run the world; it's not globalists or blacks or immigrants or fucking anyone, it's you. you are the fucking problem in your own fucking life. you have zero fucking perspective. the entire reason you're able to sit on twitter and whine about how afraid you are because someone *gasp* asked you for an interview is because nothing truly bad has ever fucking happened to you, ever. you're an entitled, privileged brat, as evidenced by the fact that you have the time and money to *sit around on twitter all day.* none of you are genuine. none of you are interested in doing the work to effect real change on the shit that matters. it's just a stupid fucking pissing contest, and you're actively making it harder for the rest of us. you are children. you reached middle school and stopped developing. i want to drop all of you into the wilderness and force you to experience some actual fucking hardship so you can realize that your entire worldview is possible only because you're able to take advantage of modern convenience.      but how can i, how could i, when i too am sitting here, taking advantage of modern convenience? aren't i the very thing that i hate? how can any of us critique anything, when all of us are covered in sludge?      i am losing my ability to be reasonable. i get in fights more often. i keep them away from the people i love, but compartmentalization can only go so far. i feel the pressure building in my  head, behind my eyes. i look forward to downtime but do nothing with it. i sit impotent, cycling through a list of possible activities and dismissing them all. it's all empty, accompanied by guilt. i should be doing more. i am not creating value, i am complaining but not generating, i am just like them. i am just like all of the ones i despise, i am becoming them, i will become them, i will die like them and with them. the bluster and anger are fruitless and only an echo of the human condition. we are not fundamentally good. we are fundamentally weak, stupid, and wretched. we are subject to cognitive distortions that we can't ever fully get a handle on, even when we're aware of them. we are subject to passions that drive us to poor decisions and hasty actions, many of them profoundly antisocial. we are angry. we are violent. we are incurably tribal. we are going to destroy ourselves, and possibly take the planet along with us.      there is no hope. there is no one coming to the rescue. everything and everyone will die and rot.

Neutral	it's hard to respond to everyone in such a thread, and also i don't know about anybody else, but i feel really daft replying "thank you" to every single comment, even though i appreciate people taking the time to help. and if not thank you, sometimes i don't know what to say.
Neutral	yes, perfect explanation
Neutral	i can't agree with you.      so you're saying if these men where muslims people wouldn't call them terrorists?       how come matthew gets called sick, while ahmed gets called a terrorist?

Neutral	agree to some extent and wouldn't be surprised either way. i've actually encountered organized trolls online that are actually monetarily rewarded for accounts identified and terminated. we know that there's corporate /state/ military collaboration (it's damn near all one at this point) but i've noticed with greater frequency these trends of using the same trolling avatar and repetitive patterns of statements both positive or negative.       plus anything remotely connected to google, and many others, artificially manipulate the stats to everything...
IdentityDirectedAbuse	your forcing that meme is how autists work
Neutral	bleh, souls games are entirely unplayable for me because as it turns out, some people have limitations on their hand coordination and reflexes. i love the lore, but i guess because i was born the wrong way, i am unwelcome. i wish i could un-do my purchase of the original game. just take back the money bamco took from me.      hearing people reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee whenever the idea of having a "hey, maybe i'm not a masochist" mode in those games is even brought up as a thought experiment just reeks of nerd idiocy. y'know, the "elite gamer wisdom" made fun of in videos like this.       so there are incels who do nothing but play videogames all day, that doesn't mean everyone else should be punished for having a life.

Neutral	i dont necessarily believe that most fatal bike accidents wouldnt be helped by helmets, but i will admit that the most traumatizing ones wouldnt.      being nearly or fully decapitated by sliding underneath a semi wouldnt be helped by a helmet. i will admit that.      but dying because you dumped headfirst helmetless at 30mph onto a curb trying to avoid someone turning left in front of you? a helmet could and most times will save your life.      scenario 2 happens all.the.fucking.time. with bike riders.

Neutral	yup. super childish. if you're trying to talk to someone and they ask a question, try to answer, or leave the conversation if you think they don't actually understand or care. you can't rudely refuse to answer a person's questions and expect them to keep talking to you. this is just basic conversational etiquette.

Neutral	sex is like oxygen - it's not a big deal unless you're not getting it.       i think the people commenting on whether other people are or aren't getting laid are probably dealing with their own insecurities regarding sex. maybe they feel they're not getting enough sex, not having good enough sex, not having long-lasting sex, not having the right kind of sex, not having sex with the right people etc.       people do and will talk about sex. it's a biological drive we have. there is no reason for a secure, content person to make someone else feel bad about their sex life.

Neutral	strange that you brought this up. last week i went to a free screening (it was a technology company event they put on. fed us dinner and got to see the movie).              the theater was showing captain marvel at 7 pm. i went out to go use the restroom, and poked my head into the other two screens to see how packed it was.              one theater had only 4 people in it, and the other had only about 8.              the next night i had tickets to go see it at a completely different theater. i ended up cancelling my tickets, but hopped on fandango to see how packed the theater was going to be. mind you this was one of those mpx imax screens at one of the newest luxury theaters in town. it should have been packed. besides the two seats i cancelled, there were only 8 other seats sold for the movie, out of over 150.              i saw the numbers for the weekend and based on my extremely limited personal experience, scratched my head in disbelief. not quite sure how it made that much money when the 3 screenings i looked at had nobody in it.
Neutral	i agree, but be aware that in nature these changes are not ever what you expect or in any way pretty, even if the outcome is beautiful.
IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	circo your political illiteracy knows no bounds.      you're completely uneducated and have no idea what you're talking about.      stick to what you do best, which is being a crippled neet living off a foid.      it's like when you tried to claim clinton not going to wi is why she lost, got bent the fuck over with data and failed to respond to any of the points made and then continued to repeat that bullshit after getting destroyed.      you're just so profoundly ignorant/clueless you have the mental capacity of a 12 year old. stop trying to discuss subjects you have not even a basic comprehension of.

PersonDirectedAbuse	i used to be a mod of that sub. got removed for banning sporite7 for a week, dude is a notorious shitposter and troll who clearly isn't there in good faith. all the other mods agreed with my assessment too except freespeechwarrior, he removed me as a mod even though on my main account i was actually over him in the mod list(account got suspended) and from that point on the sub went to shit.      i had a sticky to contain the types of posts you're talking about to, they removed that and deleted it. now the sub is full of "banned from r/drama" "banned from r/politics" "banned from r/blackpeopletwitter" "omg someone banned me for being a racist, look how my freedom of speech is being violated" type of people. it's also gone uncomfortably far to the right.

Neutral	i don't expect anything but a thank you. if someone shoveled your driveway, do you say thank you? if someone gives you free legal advice, do you say thank you? if someone gives you a tax advice, do you say thank you? if someone makes you a cake, do you say thank you? it's common courtesy. has nothing to do with why the person does the act for you, it is showing appreciation for that act.

Neutral	i believe you're over thinking it. becoming energy independent, a net exporter even, would mean no need to go to war, wouldn't it? europe having access to another market (the point of the article) would also reduce their need for war. it would reduce the leverage other exporting countries have against europe. hence "freedom" . that said, if find all these euphemisms silly, and often misleading, not so much in this case, as you do, but particularly in the naming of our laws (i.e. affordable care act)

Neutral	eh, i can totally believe some people bought this. there were some people who really, really hated obama and were nearly about as willing to believe any negative story about him as r/politics does about trump. the difference is that they largely didn't wish for democrats to be assaulted in the streets or executed.

Neutral	i carry a glock® 40 (model 40, not a .40 caliber) just for killing pitbulls. it's a longslide pistol and chambered for 10mm auto. you might think that's overkill to put down these fell beasts, considering they don't get past 60lbs, but what the longslide glock® 40 provides is unprecedented range.      in real world conditions, i wouldn't be confident in hitting a pibble sized target past 30 yards with a 9mm and iron sights, but when i'm throwing 180gr slugs at well over 1200 feet per second, i'll reach out and touch that pibble at 100 yards, easy. the modular optic system on the rear of the slide is a god-send, providing quick and accurate targeting on a small, fleeting target. in an urban environment, cover and concealment are everywhere, so the first shot may likely be the only clean shot you get. the ballistics of the 10mm auto out of a 6.02" barrel are almost unrivaled in semi-automatic pistols, and at 100 yards it's still going plenty fast to properly open the hollow-points i use, and it has a flat trajectory so i barely have to compensate for drop.      it's important to choose the right tools, and when it comes to protecting my city from the pibble menace, i choose glock®. perfection.
Neutral	centrism =/= idiosyncratic beliefs, op

Neutral	you posted a picture in [USER]? what do you think this is, a subreddit for pictures???? --things assholes think
Neutral	the sub was made to poke fun, as in jokes and memes. then it became news, serious posts theories whatever. literally the only thing i asked the new mods when they took over the sub was that i wanted no leg humping or fawning over the family. the duggars get praise everywhere the idea was that the sub was one place they wouldn't get any.    as the sub grew however the posts started to change. a lot of more sympathetic posts appeared and instead of hiding them or whatever people started badgering the mods and arguing with each other. there are four other subs to discuss the duggars and yet people insist on going on r/duggarssnark. i don't get it.  one of the mods was harassed so much they left. there is now constant trolling for absolutely no reason.       i do think a big issue is that people don't get how reddit works. you can hide posts and block people, downvotes and upvotes mean nothing.  i get downvoted all the time, i don't agree with some of the posts so i hide them. am i neutral? no because there once again 4 other subs on reddit, facebook groups, instagram accounts, forums etc. that are neutral. it is just one sub and people can't let it be.

Neutral	i feel so conflicted about this. he was my potential date...i was excited, because he said we could be exclusive fast if we clicked.      but then he told me how on hookups/fwbs he only does fingering/handjobs. he saves oral and other things for relationships. he likes girl on top, anal, blowjobs, etc. but will not do those on hookups.      the problem i have with this is that he's saying he wants his girlfriend to put in more effort for him, than a random woman did.       why should i do more for him, when a random woman got to fuck him with like zero effort on her part?!      i don't want to do more knowing we could've had sex without all the extras. i love oral as much as he does for example, but i don't like having different rules vs his hookups. i told him this, and he basically got angry. i'm not sure what to say next or if i'll even date him.       i like that he limits his std risks, but i really don't like being held to a different standard than the hookups were. what's appealing about that?
Neutral	> this **one** instance of a woman allegedly lying      mmmm.

Neutral	the primary doctrinal difference is the filioque. catholics believe that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and the son, orthodox believe that the spirit proceeds from the father through the son. catholics say that because this procession is eternal and the son is also eternally begotten of the father, this is just two different ways to say the same thing, but orthodox think that catholics are heretics for claiming that the spirit proceeds from the son. although this dispute is very esoteric and abstract, it has implications on the way we view god. some orthodox argue that the filioque raises the son up too high at the expense of the holy spirit, denying the co-equal nature of the three persons of the trinity, causing western christians to focus too much on christ and salvation rather than the spirit and holiness. i've also heard western christians make the exact opposite argument.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i feel like bros before hoes is legit when you're talking about making a really impactful decision, like where to vacation or who to emotionally support at a given moment or something along those lines.      if it's something like 'picking friends up but you got a last minute opportunity to get laid' i think that's something that a 'bro' should forgive as long as it wasn't something drastically important, like being a ride to a doctors appointment or job interview.

Neutral	last time i tried commenting in that sub my comment was auto-removed, so i'll give my thoughts on a comment by u/american_aparteid here. this is what he said:      >that's because their idea of free speech is a literal impossibility. you must eventually choose sides. **you must eventually choose whether you disallow threats of violence, fascism, and harassment, or if you allow those things**. if you disallow those things, far right and authoritarian speech cannot be tolerated. if you do allow those things then the speech of everyone *but* the far right will not be tolerated.      "free speech" does not mean any and all speech. if it did, then no speech in the united states could be outlawed since the first amendment prohibits freedom of speech from being infringed. instead, free speech refers to any and all speech *which does not infringe upon the rights of others*. things like threats are not free speech.      that said, r/conservative is a safe space.
Neutral	no wonder this dude is getting radicalized. he posts a *ton.* all in leftist echo chambers. social media is going to destroy us.
PersonDirectedAbuse	you are unequivocally wrong. medi-cal is available for all low-income california residents. all this article states is that undocumented people in california who meet low-income criteria for medi-cal are now eligible. this has been in effect in los angeles county under myhealthla since like 2015. now its going to be statewide. access to free/low cost health care is available to all california residents via medi-cal if your annual income is 138% of the federal poverty level or less for a single person.       source: i live in los angeles and work in the field of human services including helping people enroll in medi-cal.       clearly your racism and xenophobia causes a complete breakdown of any critical thinking or logical analysis of the information presented in the article.
Neutral	i'm sure you understand jesus advocated division between good and evil, not for example, saying a person cannot be trusted because where his parents are from, or telling women their faces are ugly or look like dogs, or lying and smearing someone by saying their parents were murderers, or mocking a disabled reporter for not backing up his lie. jesus said many other things that you won't quote because they cannot be taken out of context as a defense of trump, and only unambiguously portray him in a negative light.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	forgive my blunt-ness but, your mum is a bitch.      personally, i don't think you should take any of the shit she says to heart.       (i know 'easier said than done' and i'm not in your position/haven't been in that exact same dilemma  myself or at least not for a while...etc)      i also think that you should try and call her out on it sometimes. i realise that might not be an option but i think if it becomes one you need to give her a piece of your mind, because the situation you're in is not sustainable and if a big bowl of shut the fuck up is what its gonna take, then give her some.      again, i don't know the extent of the issue and haven't been in an identical situation myself, so take it with a big ol' grain of salt and perspective. tis just my opinion.

Neutral	its only for people who believe in free speech...not for people who just *pretend* to believe in free speech but secretly want to silence and control others.  if you are still toying with the idea that free speech means freedom only for people you like...then you might not be ready for voat.  that's ok...try out some alternatives who are experimenting with controlled speech and when they get enough viewers that they feel comfortable indulging in their delusions of godhood without going broke, they will start banning and restricting what users see, hear, and think just like reddit.      after watching a few of these sites deteriorate, you will eventually reach the conclusion that if speech isn't free for everyone then it isn't free for anyone.  voat will be there when you are ready.

Neutral	**martin luther king jr.**      martin luther king jr. (january 15, 1929 – april 4, 1968) was an american baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. born in atlanta, king is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, tactics his christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of mahatma gandhi helped inspire.      king led the 1955 montgomery bus boycott and in 1957 became the first president of the southern christian leadership conference (sclc).      ***      **civil rights movement**      the civil rights movement (also known as the american civil rights movement and other terms) in the united states was a decades-long struggle with the goal of enforcing constitutional and legal rights for african americans that other americans already enjoyed. with roots that dated back to the reconstruction era during the late 19th century, the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s, after years of direct actions and grassroots protests that were organized from the mid-1950s until 1968. encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation, disenfranchisement, and discrimination in the united states, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection for all americans.      after the american civil war and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s, the reconstruction amendments to the united states constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all african americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved.      ***      ^[ ^pm ^| ^exclude ^me ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit ^| ^faq ^/ ^information ^| ^source   ^]   ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	wasn't this intentional?       they designed the bill to give a small tax cut to the lower and middle class so they can be push the talking points and fool the american public (or at least sell it to their base) into thinking that the bill benefits them.       but the scam is that the tax bill lowered the taxes for the wealthy elite and massive corporations in a much more skewed and beneficial way, effectively negating any benefit the lower and middle class would have seen had this bill been passed in good faith.       it's a con. that's what people are upset about. too many ignorant people being taken advantage of by liars and propagandists with malicious intent.       similar to the way the republicans push the talking points about a potential universal health care system, "but taxes will go up!" they cry, while ignoring that people will pay less overall because of the redundancy of health insurance costs under such a system (obviously this debate would depend on the language of the legislation involved).

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	i have no idea what you're talking about you illiterate moron. i'm talking in a general sense, not even this in specific.      i swear to god circo you're the dumbest person i know.      the rightoids behind these smear campaigns are trying to bamboozle idiot boomers, nothing else.      i'd be fucking shocked if you had an above 85 iq.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	>literally attempted suicide      code for, "i threw a temper tantrum until my parents gave me my phone back"      >and other suicides have been successful under the same conditions.      which should tell you that kids having 24/7 access to cell phones and social media is part of the problem, not the solution.        i was a teenager in the time before cell phones (my parents had a car phone) and the internet (i could use my 2400 bps modem to call into local bbs systems) and i hate to sound cliche but kids were a hell of a lot better adjusted.  if we wanted to talk to someone we actually had to talk to them and there was no drive to impress (or bully) our peers on social media.      a kid under the age of 16 doesn't need a cell phone, nor do they need unrestricted access to social media.  sorry, they just don't.  at 16 you're much closer to being an adult than a kid and you gain the ability to drive so a cell phone isn't a terrible idea.        sorry, but i think we're raising a generation of kids who will be damaged by the internet, op is just one example of that and so is the related post talking about the kid who thinks they are trans.
Neutral	i meet a lot of people like this. essentially they read about physics in magazine like format.       now there is nothing wrong with being interested in physics and not knowing advanced math. but i would hardly say that's a bragging point.       it's similar to saying that you know as much as there is to know about vehicle repair without knowing how to use tools.

Neutral	natural immunity is what you have after you get many diseases for the first time (generally as a child). chicken pox, mumps, measles, etc all leave you immune for life, assuming you are occasionally re-exposed to the virus later in life.     you can also get immunity other ways, for instance the immunity many breastfed children had to poliovirus when that was epidemic.

Neutral	you must admit asexuality has more to do with lgbt than irritable bowel syndrome, since it's at least somewhat related to sexual attraction. whether you see it as an orientation (aces are attracted to one fewer gender than straight and gay people) or as a defect (the part of their brains that would cause them to feel sexual attraction is broken) is almost immaterial, given that most of them can't change that fact about themselves. for the ones who can, and are willing, the diagnosis of hyposexual desire disorder exists for that reason, and isn't going away (one would hope), but the rest of them still deserve the chance to achieve satisfaction from relationships in their lives.       whether they do this as members of the lgbt community, their own separate community, or by assimilating into mainstream society is another matter entirely. i myself have mixed feelings on this. i'm not convinced that if people came up with lgbt today it would necessarily include aces, but i also don't see how letting them stay would do any more damage to the community than the failed attempts to remove them.      also i can understand the romantic relationships are mostly a cultural construction, but you're still always going to get some people who inherently aren't a good fit for their culture, whatever tribe it is that they're are born into. so aromantic is definitely a thing i that regard. are you saying it's not a thing, or just that it's inappropriate to describe it with lgbt terms?

Neutral	you're close but not connecting the dots on this one       "the reason men are punished for sadness is because a perception of what men should be, i.e. not feminine"      okay, but why is there a perception that men should not be feminine? blind essentialism? easy answer but not quite satisfying, nor does it even somewhat resemble my anecdotal experience. i  think a disdain for 'feminine' characteristics is functionally if not literally a disdain for 'women' and especially their feelings.

Neutral	i think it's still fine. i think it's progress that people can also make fun of women like they do men. i mean men get called a fat ass all the time in media and in public. look at micheal moore or ted cruz and how they really don't care cause they know people are well intentioned. charles barkley is not a women hater, and isn't planning on joining r/mgtow or whatever women hate group.      back in the olden days women were considered off limits for comedy and i think that's silly. the more equal praise, comedy, and hate there is for both sexes than the world will be more equal.
Neutral	the original founder (who i think killed himself) would literally come back from the dead if you told him what his platform turned into.             from my understanding, he made reddit for the sole purpose of information being readily available, like a library. even libraries allow "mein kamph". you need to understand the world and how people think. if you suppress that, it only encourages worse things.             i assume most people have seen jurassic world. the dinosaur was more dangerous because of its isolation and having no real world perception.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i'm gonna have to be **r e d p i l l** for a moment and wager the main reason this guy is getting yta'd is he sounds desperate for sex. being desperate is a big turn off for women and they hate desperate men (since they have to deal with them and the fallout). fact that he was banking on it being a concert the girl was interested in him implies he is not very attractive to begin with.             lets imagine if the situation was reversed. let's say he first asked his co-worker out on a date to the concert and got a yes, but then found out his other friend was a really big fan and decided to invite her instead. the foids would fawn over this guy for not only the surface level "niceness", but demonstrates  he is not desperate for sex, implying he gets it so easily he is willing to sacrifice an obvious shacking situation for a friend. the irony being its massive douche move, since it knocks down the girl who likes him, and will make her forever wonder if they didn't do more in that hotel room than sleep in separate beds. shit like that drives people insane.

Neutral	the byzantines were christians. whether they were in asia or not, it didn't matter. when they contacted the pope, yes, it was viewed as a war of aggression, notwithstanding the fact they viewed the holy land being under occupation to also be an aggressive act. muslim rulers were also very obviously eyeing eastern europe and entering into europe through spain, trying to attack further east multiple times. was there an ulterior motive for most of the crusaders and even the pope, and are their motives almost completely alien to a modern human? yes, of course, that doesn't mean the three arrow needs to say crowder was completely wrong, because he *wasn't.* both completely stripped any complexity from the situation to make one side look more innocent than the other.

Neutral	just for the record op there was a girl and both her and the overweight girl come off as pretty much your classic high school mean girls... however op comes off as a bigger asshole because she made the post to basically pat herself on the back and get validation from a bunch of sexist, fat-hating male redditors.       also, the overweight girl may have personally insulted op, but it was just her saying she was ugly... when op then made an instagram poll, it was basically all her classmates at once calling the overweight girl ugly. knowing one person thinks you're ugly is way easier to handle than knowing *everyone* thinks you're ugly.
Neutral	man, that's a far more considered and thoughtful response than my barely-coherent madman's rant merited, if you were to ask me.      strictly speaking, my issue isn't with technology - technology is a dumb object, but humanity is a dumber object and has only managed to hurt itself with the power tools. the shed remains unbuilt. my issue is with civilisation, and largely rests on my belief that civilisation has failed.      it's like if you were simulating a financial market, but when you click "run simulation", instead of running the simulation, the machine wipes your entire dataset, hard faults, and power cycles. human civilisation has completely failed to attain any of the meaningful goals set out for it. it's a large-scale tribalist shitshow led around by marketeers because we, as a species, don't understand how to leave other tribes alone and let them be as they want to be, and we're far too eager to jump onboard anything that lets us feel smug about it.      note that, while i advocate for the destruction of computers, i say nothing about the machinegun or high explosives.       my position, as it is, lies somewhere between the most far-right of right-wings (constitutional imperialism when?!) and extremist accelerationism. i want to see all the groups, all the tribes, big and small, arm themselves to the teeth and then go at it hammer and tongs. there are lessons that humanity needs to learn, and they're not going to learn them out of a fucking book. they're also not going to learn them without incurring a few bruises, and the sooner they make peace with that particular fact the better.      the thing that stops us all getting what we want, is our insistence that everyone else get what *we* want as well.      more fundamentally: *we cannot, ourselves, create change in others*.
Neutral	i just say "non-whites" since that's really all the term is. it just paints a line between one vague skin tone and literally every other human on the planet. it's asinine and divisive.

Neutral	content relating to this has been and is currently still on the sub. in fact someone reposted my exact post and it remains up.       i've had stuff deleted by mods before and i'm usually understanding.       in this case, the mod literally can't be straight with me and just falls back on muting then banning me. i take more issue with that than the removal of my post.
Neutral	and i think that a lot of that is due to the nature of both social media and the legacy media.  it's a messy landscape, and to be perfectly honest the way that a lot of news outlets have come to write stories on what controversial tweet is trending is garbage reporting and absolutely lazy.

Neutral	i walk my dogs in the morning, in the summer, in arizona. you just get up earlier and resign yourself to sweating. it's kind of a bummer because it's really too hot to jog with them, but as long as it's under 100f and not in the direct sun, it's not that bad.      of course, this is impossible if you're a moron and get dogs that do poorly in heat, like akitas or huskies. i have a papillon and a chihuahua, though. my pap eventually gets really panty and tired when it's hot, but my tiny little asshole loves the heat. fucker sunbathes on the patio in direct sun when it's over 100f and comes in all hot like he's a coal you put in the fire.      seriously though. people love to complain about the heat here, but it's not that bad. you adjust your schedule and clothing with the weather, much like people do when they live someplace that it snows.

PersonDirectedAbuse	corporate lobbyists lobbied until they passed a bill to eliminate campaign fund limits from lobby groups dude... corporate lobbyists literally write the fucking laws and approve them in backroom deals through legal bribery that is the definition of lobbying. this shit has been happening since before the fucking federal reserve was created and metal-backed currency was eliminated in the 1930's. a bunch of bankers met on jekyll island off the gulf coast and created it with no consent from the public. this is an old problem and we're seeing the height of it right fucking now. it was a bandaid after the great depression that was caused on purpose anyhow - the us got rich off the great depression, as dr. milton friedman has described - if the great depression started outside of the us the us would not be as rich as it is today - the us effectively stole the worlds gold by causing a global economic crisis and then weimar germany experienced hyperinflation - leading to the rise of the brown shirts and the appointment of hitler to chancellor of germany. man, you have a lot to learn. did you know that g.w. bush's granddad, prescott bush was an international investment banker who was directly funding hitler's rise to power? he was even charged with aiding the enemy and had his domestic assets froze until the war was over.

Neutral	i do think it is a parody and satire as you say but it's not subtle in anyway shape or form.  usually the best horror stories tend to be a little more subtle with their themes and really most stories in general. get out to me seemed like it wanted to be a dark comedy not a horror movie but was forced through marketing and peele to be a horror movie. neither get out or us were particularly scary as well. none of the horror of either stuck with me after the movie. movies like the exorcist, hereditary, the shinning, evil dead all stuck with me long after the movie was over. with get out i was like ok that was fun and forgot about it until us was announced. i feel peele if he wanted to stay away from full comedy would be able to write a really good episode of dark mirror or movie along those lines.
Neutral	we never forget those images, but we are better prepared for those scenarios in real life. we also gain a deeper understanding of death, and what a truly "peaceful" way to go is. oh, and to avoid certain areas, like brazil and anything concerning saudi arabian princes and such.

Neutral	in my opinion, it's fairly obvious that many of these social media platforms were created, (if not initially, then during transition to corporate entities recognizing their inherent value) as large data collection centers to study human interaction and behavior...       i have come to conclude that reddit is mostly moderated by an advanced a.i. system and one of its many objectives is to get humans accustomed to having their entire lives micromanaged by artificial intelligence...       any thoughts about this potentiality?
Neutral	this is reminiscent of infamous '*ticking bomb*' scenarios being used to promote evil. someone posits that unless we do x (some shockingly unethical thing, e.g. torture), then some unspeakable catastrophe will inevitably occur. besides [typically] fallacious, it's typically disingenuous.       a reasonable solution is that if someone is demonstrably aligned with some foreign power, like israel or russia or china, then it makes sense to keep them away from sensitive areas.       mere religion/ethnicity should not be enough.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	while there is an obvious leftist/liberal bias across many subreddits, i don't think it accurately represents everyone on reddit. i think they're just a very vocal minority, and they seek out different opinions to downvote and brigade against them to create the appearance that they're right or belong to a majority. maybe i'm wrong and reddit is actually hopelessly cucked, but i hope not.

Neutral	suppose i'm nega-trump: i want to help people more than corporations. i permanently cut personal taxes by 10%, while temporarily decreasing corporate taxes by 1% (which will expire in a few years). i sell this to corporations as a yuuuge tax break.      but since taxes were massively cut, the national debt is piling up. to cut costs i cut corporate welfare - farm subsidies to big ag, stuff like that. that's probably not enough, so whatever party gets elected in future will have to raise corporate taxes again to keep the national debt under control. but that's not my problem because i'll be out of office by then.      is this a good deal for corporations?
Neutral	oh yeah, these types *hate* cops. apparently all cops are evil because they support a system that gets abused by shitty people.
Neutral	it's only a crime in new zealand fortunately. i say all social media platforms should just ignore nz's demands and let nz block them from the country's isps. let nz go full on china because they can't handle the reality of a mass shooting. then the citizens will rise up and protest nz for mass censorship and hopefully vote their pm out.

Neutral	you don't fear death unless you're alive. and you fear death because life is valuable.       and why not? you've presented no valid rationale as to why we shouldn't have existed. "because you would then die" isn't meaningful. the question is whether the life is meaningful. death is simply the conclusion of life.

Neutral	thatcher took over at a time of massive strikes and economic depression. she took power away from unions, faced down a massive miners strike and transformed the uk to a finance based economy. this lead to a massive economic boom for the south/a smaller boom for the rest of the country but many northern mining based communities suffered from high unemployment. thatcher also underfunded many government programmes in order to cut taxes etc. she's kind of like the uk's reagan and very divisive.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	yes, that's exactly what i'm saying. the entire fandom has given the keys to the fascists with their constant appeasing and dehumanization, regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, these "far left" individuals are doing more to help fascism then literal fascists ever could. there's a reason why there's a well-documented furry->alt-right pipeline and a lot of it has to do with how the fandom glorifies fascist narratives.      i've seen quite a few people fall from "ha ha joking" into outright nazism because that environment radicalizes.

Neutral	let me find out one of my parents says that to me. i'd be soo damn infuriated that it would propel me out of suicide and give me a reason to live again. your dad is a sorry excuse for a man saying that to his suicidal child. disgusting. i can set a standard that makes him an irrelevant worm in comparison too. but that isn't fair, is it?           if i were you: "oh alright. well then, with that, our "relationship" has actually just ended. i will no longer speak to you again nor ask you for help. since you seem nonchalant about my existence in this world, goodbye. don't speak unless it is in an apologetic manner for the absolute filth you just hurled at me. as for the financial matter, thank you for stating the terms of business. i'll work out a way to sustain myself, since you both have made yourselves abundantly clear. i do not and will not expect monetary aid from you. thank you."           i'm in a similar place as you. both of my parents are acting insane, though one of them actually is a sociopath. and yes i've had suicidal thoughts on and off almost my whole life. my sociopath parent has plenty of money, houses, etc. we've never had a relationship except when i was a baby(doesn't count). i've literally told this parent to not put me in their will. it was to send a message. what's that message?           money isn't love, and i don't need that from you. i never needed it. i needed a parent, but now it's too late and i'm indifferent(or more accurately don't want a relationship). just like you've been my entire life. if you don't have an innate desire out of your own heart to help your own child, then i absolutely do not want anything at all from you. i don't accept blood money. period.           leave your parents house asap. i'm telling you. i waited too long, don't be like me. do it now. you won't heal/grow properly unless you do. they're probably the ones making you suicidal. leave and rely on yourself if you have to. that's what i'm doing right now and it feels awesome. if you have to wait and save up money for college i say it's worth it. the satisfaction of not taking a dime from your parent that doesn't care if you exist is priceless. be independent asap. you have innate worth and dignity just by virtue of being a human being. you need to respect yourself too, and know that you have worth. just because they are your parents, that does not give them impunity to hurl crap at you without consequences. stand up for yourself, respectfully. be confident you're in the right and don't let anger consume you. you have value, and are valued, and nobody can take that away. work however much it takes to get out. once you're independent and floating your own boat, reexamine your suicidal thoughts if they're there still. i know it sounds kinda dumb but literally tell your suicide to take a back seat and do this task first. i can guarantee you will at least feel better, and maybe not suicidal anymore. process of elimination, eliminate the two glaring suspects. don't keep debating within yourself like "oh maybe i can stay longer and they will treat me better" etc. in your heart of hearts you know whether or not your living environment is toxic to your mental health. sorry for ranting.           god bless.

Neutral	nobody said it's wrong. it's just stupid and pointless. a door is a door. there's no need to make a door something part of your agenda. if you write "toilets" or "wc" in a door, it's still a door, it's not a "gender neutral door"; because doors don't care about genders. they are doors.
Neutral	i really like how you said, because you were emotionally abused you have a thin skin. you never had the chance to develop a "normal" amount of self-esteem etc, along with getting anxiety and depression etc. so it only makes sense that you'd get hurt easier and cry easier.    sometimes i wonder what's wrong with me, because i cry so easily as well, and things get to me quickly, why i struggle standing up for myself etc. and you just put into words what i always kind of knew myself but couldn't verbalise. i wish some people would try and see it from that perspective too, instead of just brushing people as "just too sensitive" off. everything has a reason.       of course, (unfortunately) that doesn't mean it isn't necessary to toughen up, because that's the world we live in, and while i wish people sometimes had more understanding and empathy for others, i can't expect to have the whole world change because of how i am. i think a "nicer" way to look at this is, not to toughen up because of how the world works and its "cruel" ways, but toughen up in the right places to do yourself something good and help yourself have a better life. because the world isn't gonna change (sadly, i guess).

Neutral	we all know once a handout is established with the american people it's almost politically impossible to scale it back or remove it completely.  it's why we nobody wants to touch the radioactive swamp creature we call social security even though it will be insolvent by 2034.        obama was focused on providing a welfare program, not fixing health care.  it's why the majority of the bill was about moving poor people to medicaid programs and price gouging politically weak demographics in order to subsidize politically strong ones.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	oh.      oh, *this is too rich.*      teen vogue has been waving the genderblob battle flag for a while now. in 2017 they released a guide on anal sex desperately trying to avoid words like "male" and "female," instead using distinctions like "for those of you with a prostate."      this got quite a lot of the internet to, shall we say, look at them with askance. of course, teen vogue's woke defenders derided people by calling them *prudes*, avoiding addressing the fact that humans by and large are a sexually dimorphic species.      last year around august, [one teen vogue writer advocated making up gender-neutral words for family members to "avoid erasing women and non-binary people"]([URL]) because apparently words like "mother," "sister," "wife," "aunt" and so on erase women.      by stepping away from that agenda even for a moment, the tucutes they've tried so hard to court are ready to burn them at the stake!

Neutral	>what's funny is a lot of immigrants who come to america are typically religious and pretty conservative. muslim, mexican, and even african immigrants are devoutly religious and believe in some sort of moral code that is , one way or another, in line with white-christian-american's moral code.      > if identity politics weren't played so fucking hard by right leaning talking heads, pundits, and representatives, a lot more "traditional" immigrants would be on their side. they could be the party of conservatism and religious traditionalism, instead they're the party of white-christian's.       are these people for real. i have a hard time believing they really think this.      
IdentityDirectedAbuse	gays reproduce by seducing children, as per the snappy quote etc., etc.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	i have a large circle of friends. male and female but mostly guys but i have 2 guys friends who are my best friends. we know each other since since we were toddlers. we are really close. we always have each other's backs and we always tell each other everything that's going on in our personal lives and we confide in each other and we have been here for each other for the good and the bad. for better or for worst doesn't only apply to marriage. matter of facts, i would rather confide in my friends then my wife because i feel much more at home with them. there is no high expectations and we have more fun together. one time, my cousin told me that i was gay for that and my wife should be the one person i should confide him. i told her to fuck off. i'm not gonna look like a wimp in front of my wife. me and my guy friends relate better men to men and we do a better job at encouraging each other and lifting each other up. because guys have an approach that's much more affective approach when supporting each other. women like to vent and nurture each other and they tell you that they feel sorry for you and caress you and all those touchy feely bullshit. guy to guy encouragements are more affective and helpful because we give each other tough love. when we fall, we tell each other to pick our heads up, get our asses up, suck it up and deal with it. we look for solutions to problems and we go head and solve the problems. to me it's the opposite. it would be gay if i went ahead and cried in my wife's arms. fuck that. and anyone who thinks it's gay for guys to turn to each other and confide in each other as well as having a close relationship guy to guy, fuck you. it's okay for guys to have a close friendship. it doesn't make us gay. women talk about how they suffer from sexism and inequality ? i call bullshit at that.

Neutral	if the issues with interbreeding was such an issue we would have so many more problems in the middle east and such because cousin marriages over there aren't that unusual (which as an arab living in the usa was weird until i read it's like a 2% or something increase in birth defects for cousin marriages) and mostly a result of the arranged marriages stuff.       it's almost always when you have siblings or parent-child and that's more of a risk of recessive traits being amplified. it's the successive and repeated incest that usually is what causes major problems. cousin marriages only increase the chances of birth defects from 2%-3% to 6%-7%       the focus on birth defects usually are mislead and unfortunately changes the discussion from "these marriages are bad because of power dynamic" to "its bad to the child's health" which tends to ignore basic genetics and biology and weakens the argument.

Neutral	the shuffler is fine. our brains focus more on negative outcomes so we notice the time we drew poorly 6 times in a row but forget that we had drawn amazing the past 6 games.      it's only human to feel bad about bad beats but you have to learn to roll with the punches long-term if you want to stick with mtg and mana screw.      there *are* alternatives out there for people who like ccgs and *hate* manascrew.       eternal card game is one i highly suggest. no mana screw/flood and fun as hell. not quite magic, though.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i'm from mass. fall river is full of blue collar portuguese people that could care fucking less about jews. also, my state is the bluest damn one in the country, other than california, and we all know how much a leftist loves a hate crime - enough to hoax one. this is the home of snotty liberal college and the kennedys... altho i'm almost positive jfk would be called a fascist by them if he lived now.    everyone here thinks this is utter bullshit.
Neutral	i hate it when people force me to find a partner already... i choose not to get married. i have witnessed domestic verbal abuse and domestic abuse while growing up. my friends, whether they were guy or girls always had petty issues concerning their partners. no one i knew who got married were perfectly happy with their marriage lives. they always had something to nitpick and fuss about and it got irritating to hear.  and it's scary how some people stage murders to pick up their children's or spouses' life insurance.      plus i don't want to have to deal with crying, screaming children. i grew up with many siblings and pretty much raised them with my mother. homeschool, hygiene, to everything else, etc etc etc and i am tired. i can't deal with more kids. they are even more frustrating to deal with as teens.       so yes, i am never ever getting married to anyone and it's my choice. traveling around and focusing on my career are my priorities. so shut your trap and leave me alone.
Neutral	i hate this change because the traffic in shenzhen when i go to work is insane (though i don't think my bike is affected) because the roads are poorly thought out (shocker). it's faster to walk or ebike than to take a taxi because drivers decide that their side having two lanes isn't enough - they need to make another lane for themselves in oncoming traffic. lights have no bearing on the flow of traffic, either. y'know, the usual china driving stuff.      i'm going to try to get a driver's license pretty soon, but i'm not exactly looking forward to being on the road...
Neutral	> the concept of bitcoin is the most important achievement of our era.      really? the most important achievement? it hasn't been modern medicines, traveling to space, creating the internet? none of those things?      it's a fake highly volatile magic money?
Neutral	i visited macau for about 10 hours and felt like that was pretty much enough time - which is why i'm incredulous that someone would choose to live there for a full year. its only got 600,000 population, it really does not compare with hong kong or singapore whatsoever.
Neutral	hey shes getting her bullshit in gender studies
Neutral	i feel like many people have forgotten something:      if you're ace, that doesn't mean you don't wan't/like/have sex. it just means that you're not sexually atracted to someone. you may see a person and think they look nice, you may date them and you may get into a relationship with them. you may kiss and cuddle and hold hands. you may even have sex with them. but you don't see someone and think about how nice it would be to fuck them.      tell me if my tired ass that didn't get enough sleep for a week forgot something

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	usually when a leftist kills a bunch of people with a firearm they just focus on the gun to try to get guns banned.  the fact that a leftist did it is irrelevant to society.  when a bernie-bro tried to murder multiple gop congressmen with an sks the media was like "meh".

Neutral	this is such a silly take. you don't really think this...      >having a lot of plotlines and characters just so they can die doesn't make the books better       ...was martin's motivation, do you? because that's crazy. maybe his books meander a bit - i don't really care about all the medieval foodie shit - but i also recognize he's trying to paint a complete cultural representation of this fictional world.  considering what an overwhelming writerly feat that is, it's no wonder it's taking him so long to finish.      i like both the tv show and the books. one couldn't exist without the other. both accomplish things the other couldn't, just by the nature of their respective mediums. i don't see the point in making it a competition between which one is better. other than impotent nerd rage, i guess.
Neutral	i don't understand that meme
Neutral	i just finished watching the documentary "won't you be my neighbor" and i feel that the american people have disrespected mr. rogers as a whole. i am aware that not all of reddit is america, but i'm primarily speaking about the american state, as its the only world view i have right now.      mr. rogers taught us to love one another in spite of differences. the man so hated television that he changed it by himself through his program. i feel that we as the children who grew up on his show have failed him and his memory by dividing ourselves. america is so divided these days that people are faking hate crimes and it is believable to an extent.  i think that we as his former audience need to remember the tolerance he preached.      his message of everyone is special is often derided as being unrralistic as "if everyone is special then no one is." but that isnt what everyone is special means. it means that we are all deserving of anothers love for what makes us unique. yes there are bad people out there. im not denying that, but i think we all need to take a step back, and rather than fight over our differences, bond over our similarities. the world is a mess right now, and we as humans need to band together to fix it.

Neutral	y'know, i'm calling satire on this one. not because it's satire, but because refuse to believe anything they say is at all serious. like, i know it's a verified account of a well-known "charity" (huge fucking air quotes around that one), but jesus christ!  they kidnap pets from loving homes and fucking kill them!      and then they make these strawman arguments about things no animal rights activist would actually believe. why, just last year they campaigned for polar bears to go extinct, because breeding them in zoos is unethical. i swear, next time they're going to say treating schistosomiasis in the developing world is actually bad *because parasitic worms deserve to live too!!*      fuck this charity and everything to do with them. the less that people take peta seriously, the better.
Neutral	obviously by "study" it means he is aware they aren't strictly positivist disciplines (though he wouldn't use the word "positivism"), and that it is therefore not "science", and is therefore invalid.      i sit right across from someone who thinks like this at my  job, and the one thing we can't talk about is soft sciences and humanities.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	and ingrian finns, etc. etc.      in the ingrian finns case, they were first deported from their homelands to "aid collectivization" (some being sent to kazakhstan and central asia).  then 7 years later they were removed from the border areas with estonia and finland so that the soviets could create an area "free of finnic people" (sending them again to kazakhstan amongst other places).  then another 7 years later the soviets deliberated on whether the rest should be kept in ingria, since they thought it would legitimize their future occupation of finland.  eventually they said "fuck it, these ingrian finns can't be trusted" and so they executed or shipped off most of the rest (to siberia this time).      their population estimate in 1917 was 170,000 and their current known population is 50,000.  what makes me most sick is that the communists intended to only keep puppet ethnic populations so that they could use them to conquer opposing states that had similar ethnic groups.  communists are truly depraved.

Neutral	a real suicidal person wouldn't tell anyone. they'd just do it.      yeah but i'm a wimp and probably wouldn't follow through but i'm still having these unending thoughts every day and it's hard and i want your support.      i made the mistake of telling them this when they were yelling at me about wasting my time and being lazy and getting bad grades and i'm not shitting you my dad told me "well if you're gonna be lazy and just waste space in the world you might as well do it." i'm not even doing that poorly. i have all a's and a b. and the b is in fucking physics for pre med college students, it's hard.       and they actually asked me *why* i'm suicidal. i just fucking am i can't help it it's been like this for 5 years but it's been a lot worse recently. then my dad fucking turns to my mom and asks her why she was suicidal in high school and she says "because my parents didn't love me or care about me and put me in dangerous situations, and i didn't tell anyone i just attempted but failed," and then turns back to me and says "what's your excuse? do you really think we don't love you or something?" like i'm sorry i'm losing the my life is hard competition but i can't just stop feeling like this. and then he finishes up with "you won't actually do it. you're too selfish." honestly fuck my life at this point.       i started crying and told them i just want some support right now and my dad said "you really think we don't give you fucking support" and went on some tangent about how hard his life is because of me and how much he does to support me like no i'm talking about right now this topic i just want you to tell me it's gonna be okay.      all of this was after a like glorious  2 month period of my parents being really nice to me then they hit me with all this shit.      i'm so hurt and starting to think i can't be around them anymore. they're behavior just changes so fucking drastically like this and i don't think i can live with them any longer. i was planning on living at home my freshman year of college (next year) to save money since they offered and we live close to the campus i'm gonna go to but now they're saying they're not sure if they wanna help me anymore and i was told "have fun trying to cover your dorm expenses with your financial aid because we're not gonna help you pay for it." like they're testing if i'll actually leave. i'm fucking confused and trapped. shit fucking sucks man i'm really hurt.       it's not a good day.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i think most incels are pretty young, under the age of 30 usually. it took me until i was 40+ years old to stop being anti-social/a-social due to bullying, rape, being continuously taken advantage of, and then bullying by fellow adults including my parents* until i was ~40 years old [*they apologized once they found out i was autistic].  i could see how a young man growing up in a culture of rape-culture, toxic-masculinity, and precarious masculinity could be that bitter and say the stuff they say on incel forums. however, once they start planning to hurt others and going through with even a small amount of those plans they are criminals and dangerous to everyone around them. i think the contrapoints video on incels explains my attitude towards them.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	that's why i don't support the slaughter of innocent men, women, or children. neither did the reagan administration. real world foreign policy often puts you into positions where you have to ally with a bad guy to get rid of the really bad guy. world war ii is the prime example of this. we allied with the ussr, an evil regime, to take down an even worse regime at the time.       arming the rebels in afghanistan is the same exact scenario. the rebels in afghanistan weren't good people, but the soviets were worse and were attempting conquest to build their empire.       -      foreign policy is far more complex than people on reddit often want to believe. they want to believe in a world where everything is black and white and all our decisions are super easy. they're not. they never are.

Neutral	while i am no anti-natalist, calling someone's suffering "emo teen crap" can discourage people who have similar thoughts from talking about how they feel which obviously makes it much harder to overcome such feelings due to fear of judgment and carries a nasty implication that there's some sort of "right" or "proper" way of suffering.

Neutral	i got shit reflexes and coordination aswell, but you can get past it. here, let me give you some advice:             dark souls 1 - just roll into boss attacks mostly, their attacks are really telegraphed so even with garbage reaction times you should still see em coming. for most common hollows, don't lock on, run past them, pivot and backstab (their tracking is really shitty so you can dance circles around their attacks). you can also run straight to the boss rooms since you get iframes on going through fog walls. learn your parry timings, especially on black knights and gwyn, the greatsword ones are the easiest due to how telegraphed their attacks are. don't wear heavy armor and always fast roll unless you got that sweet 76 poise and a high stability greatshield. oh, and always kill the dogs first.             dark souls 2 - the pve in this game is cancer, but you should be in this game for the pvp. the tracking is insane so backstabbing enemies is not a cakewalk. there are no iframes on fog walls so getting into boss rooms is even more of a task but the great thing is, the bosses in this game are super easy - they're mainly just variants of armored knights. my advice is, increase your adaptability so you can get atleast 99 / 100 agility for those extra roll / backstep iframes. upgrade your weapons as soon as possible and keep your equip load under 50.             dark souls 3? it's pretty much just ds1 but with a some bloodborne style faster paced action in it. you can still easily backstab enemies but parrying is somewhat less instant which makes it harder. the game also hands out rolls like free candy, meaning you can spam it and become a lot harder to hit. like the first game, kill the dogs first.             i'll add more to this later.

Neutral	the problem is that there's no real way to argue that x is not a reference to y other than just saying it's  unlikely. once someone believes that something is a reference or has a deeper meaning, it's really hard to prove them wrong, even if they don't have any evidence or compelling reason. i'd like to think the burden of proof is on the people trying to prove a connection, but from my experience, it's almost always my burden to try to disprove even the flimsiest connections.

PersonDirectedAbuse	the rebrobate mind is given to selfish self gratifying desires as seen here. this sodomite would truly have you believe that somehow his temporal and mundane feelings are anything compared to the will of god. these feelings are no doubt the manifestation of profound and deepseated self hatered and a myopic desire to be special. with such a person sometimes the only you do pray the holy sprit moves heart away from the vileness it has found itself in.

Neutral	the brilliance of the actual text of three kingdoms is that to an apolitical or inexperienced person it seems like a chronicle of great deeds, heroes and villains, justice and adventure. rereading it some years later it can become clear that everyone sucks, everyone is to some degree an amoral warlord whose public perception is dictated by pr, and the three kingdoms period was a total shitshow. ultimately it is a biting criticism of dynastic power and politics.       really the liu, guan, zheng triumvirate establishes very quickly on that 'holdings/wives/innocent bystanders/scandals come and go but family is like an arm or leg, i could never punish my brother for this misguided error' is their collective get-out-free card for a lot of things, and the three are very adept at politically shadowboxing in a way that other figures like cao cao lack the very close relationships to manage. liu bei inspires loyalty like it's his superpower, but loyalty is ultimately a complex web of relationship in the political world over a simple virtue.
Neutral	in narcissistic families, there is a golden child and a scapegoat. one gets everything. the other is openly oppressed. both are abused by the games. it makes the two of them hate each other. i often view our system as a narcissistic family writ large.
Neutral	i am no police lover, but it is easy to understand their apathy in this case. most of the murder victims are a part of the gang game, and it's likely that they killed or injured other people. the police just don't care in this case since it is a part of daily life there, and the victims aren't saints themselves.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	so you're saying muslims are subhuman morons incapable of doing anything clever? your bigotry disgusts me.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i have sympathy for them in the "we're all just people" sense of the word.  like, i can recognize monsters aren't supernatural. they're the product of some aspect of society gone wrong. maybe they were abused or maybe they just watched too many sitcoms that define manhood in terms of how many women you bed.  if the multiverse exists, i'm sure there's a bizzarro version of me who got himself red-pill'd after an early broken heart.        but, ultimately, that sympathy doesn't really mean anything. we don't need to nicer to them when they throw one of their hate-filled tantrums. sad stories are sad, but they don't excuse monstrous behavior.  most of the people calling for sympathy for incels are just trying to derail the conversation.

Neutral	i can't go to my friends so i'm coming to reddit.   i have never been good at saying how i feel. i have been with my girlfriend for about two and a half years and we live together, just started our careers and are moving in to a bigger place together. i love her with everything i have, so i guess please keep that in mind.   when she comes home from work after a long or bad day she takes it entirely out on me as if i'm a verbal punching bag and i've done so much to try to cheer her up, listen to her, help her get her mind off of it, everything i can do. she doesn't get better until after she talks to her mom. i ask her about her day i get nothing. she tells her mom everything, all about her day and i get cast aside. then shes laughing as if everything is great.   after i'm there trying to comfort her to no avail, then her getting instantly better, i start to feel like i'm not needed. then she doesn't asks about how my day went. she sometimes will, but i can't even finish telling her things and its only when shes in a good mood (which is maybe 1 or 2 days a week).   so i bring it up, i get nothing but angry pushback. this time because i waited for us to be cuddled up in bed where i could be holding her while i told her how i was feeling.  i just don't know what to do and feel like it's my fault because even if i had brought it up earlier it would have still been my fault for feeling this way... am i really the problem? how do i get better at saying how i feel when i'm upset?   again. i love her with everything i have and i know she loves me. i just feel like i cant make her happy

Slur	there's a bar in this area that used to sell "crack fries." they were called that because they were addictive and made with cracked pepper.      a bunch of white kids from the local college called it racist, staged a bunch of protests, and got the company to change the name to "cosmic fries."      a decade earlier, another batch of white kids from that same college did the exact same thing to force a chain of coffee stores to change their name from "beaners" to "bigbys."

Neutral	a pointless post that simply... ends out of nowhere
Neutral	people think it's a dumb statement because it's a trueism. yes, everyone should be careful. however, one of those is wholly more dangerous than the others. my cousin was hit by a bike when he was a kid. it caused some scars and some teeth got messed up requiring braces. being hit by a car would have killed him.      cars are larger, heavier, and faster than bikes and those on foot. the menace to our streets is not bikers. elite bikers top off to about 25 mph. i do bike cardio for an hour 4 days a week and i top off at 18 mph so i doubt your average bike commuter is lance armstrong-ing her way through busy intersections such that cops need to be there harassing them. especially since they don't seem to have an issue with cars that block crosswalks or don't respect right of way. which, again, is going to be more dangerous than a bike given the same maneuvers.       cops are very much bullying bikers because they know they can. the cops in that vid (and other ones i've seen that focused on this issue) were literally blocking the bike lane then punishing bikers for not using the very passage they have blocked so it's not even an issue of "being careful".

IdentityDirectedAbuse	never heard that explained like this, thanks. but seems to me like this difference is a result of the groups of peoples who follow these different sects. mediterraneans are hotheaded, but perfectly content to go off and do some questionable shit, cross themselves and ask for forgiveness, then go off on their merry way. slavs are less forgiving and give less fucks, and so are likely to need some more faith in the spirit, and less in a personification of it.      meanwhile germanics like myself have autism levels that are altogether way too high for any of that shit, and needed protestantism to tell both of them to fuck off a la martin luther so we could go do our own thing. anglicanism after the restoration of the english monarchy and the full embracement of the royal society seems like the perfect doctrine to somebody like myself. too bad we had to have ourselves an (((enlightenment))) and ruin it.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	why you do need dysphoria to be trans      1. dysphoria can be defined in a non medical way. such as "the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex." it's weird that such an intersectional definition comes (besides the fact that it ignores nonbinaries) is from the racist and sexist google dictionary that says sexism can apply to men and racism can apply to white people.      2. dysphoria is the will to be the opposite gender and transgender is the will to be the opposite gender. you might notice that it is the same thing. it is like calling the size of paper a "non-ledger tabloid" (don't get me started about paper sizes)      3. it makes dysphoria meaningless. thousands of people are dysphoric and suffer from it. even the broad dysphoria definition proposed ontop can cause psychological problems. why make the word meaningless?      4. (mostly a counter to point 6) most transphobic people's argument is "you gender is unrelated to how you feel". the word dysphoria helps people understand that it is a quantifiable studied phenomenon. what do you think will generate more transphobia, saying gender is a feeling or saying gender is a mental state.      5. i don't believe in cultural appropriation but i assume the tumblr person does. so is non dysphoric transgenderism not appropriated transgenderism?

Neutral	this wasn't some passionate choice, this girl stopped eating and drinking several times. that takes enormous discipline.  she was suffering horribly.  of course if you make it through, things might change.        but again, what is the purpose of forcing people to suffer?  if they want to end their suffering what is the reason for stopping them?  so they don't go to hell?  i do think if someone has children, suicide is a selfish choice, unless you can provide a better situation for the kids. it's not right to bring children into the world and then abandon your obligations. but otherwise, why is it important for people to suffer?

Neutral	please note that i'm not some troll, i do genuinely believe many conspiracies on this subreddit, but this is one i can't get behind.      a common argument is that the rates for allergies, alzheimer's, cancer, etc. are rising, just as vaccination rates. many people draw the conclusion that there is causation between the two. come on lads, we learned this early on. **correlation does not equal causation.**       allergy rates and cancer rates and autoimmune disorder rates all that jazz are rising. well no shit, sherlock. the population is increasing rapidly, and the people genetically predisposed to these conditions reproduce and create more who are genetically predisposed.      take 4 people. 2 men, 2 women. 3 have to predisposition to alzheimer's, 1 does. each man has children with one of the women. the man who has a predisposition to alzheimer's passes it on to 2 kids, say both men. the couple without it doesn't pass it on (obviously) to their, say, 2 girls. now half the population has it. again, they pair up, and both men pass on the predisposition to the future generation, and now the whole population has it.      obviously this is a *much* smaller scale, but it's comparable to our current world's situation. if you think the increase of rates for certain things is anything but mathematics and genetics, you're living a lie. one person with a random gene mutation passed that on to multiple people, and those people passed it on to multiple people, and now we're here. exponential rates can start out increasing in tiny increments, but then get to the billions in the blink of an eye. we've all blinked and we're looking for excused to not accept the reality that formed in the moments our eyes were closed.

Neutral	ops logic is flawed.  but funny enough i do strangely agree that it's fair that the item that has the larger revenue in the movie theater case deserves to be the one that makes the most profit.      assigning movie tickets a higher cost of operation is a little unfair because if there were no movie tickets sold, then people would not buy concessions.  that is to say concessions greatly boost profits, but without licenses for movies you wouldn't be able to sell concessions either.   that doesn't even go into the fact that you have to pay more in employee salaries, maintenance and rent, supplies to support concessions sales.

IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	>first off, isn't that judaism?      yes and no. christians believe in the old testament, they still believe that their god had a favored people. the same god that commanded genocide against people who didn't worship the god of the israelites. why even choose to have a group of people to live piously and be an example to the rest of the world. why does this group get the privilege of experiencing miracles firsthand, but anyone outside the group who so much as doubts his existence is put to the sword.       and like i said, it's offset by christian dominionism. some christians won't be happy until literally everyone, including uncontacted stone age tribes who will kill *anyone* who tries to set foot on their island (see the north sentinel island missionary), has converted. just because the son of their god, who also claims to be their god, has different views than his father, who is also him, doesn't really change that the god, who is the father of himself, really didn't care that much for non-israelites.       oh, and jesus was actually racist as well. in matthew 15:21-28, jesus ignores the suffering of a canaanite woman and refuses to heal her daughter, comparing her to a dog. at least until she strokes his ego. yeah, anyone can be one in christ, but if you're the wrong race, it's going to take a little extra to earn it.

Neutral	you are a voice of reason. i hope you don't get downvoted to hell.       it's even easier now with morning after pills, etc.      let's set aside rapes incest and dangerous pregnancies. they don't account for 80% or so of the convenience abortions.       what those 80% are really saying is they lacked the self control and were too unintelligent to plan ahead to 1) abstain 2) have oral sex instead 3) have sex but use a condom 4) have sex but use the pill 5) have sex but use a diaphragm 6) have sex but use a morning after pill.       there are literally a half dozen other choices that could have prevented their situation.

Neutral	and? women were not equal in society in the least back then. its pretty understandable that those men back then wouldn't make women equal members in the early church because it would give their enemies another reason to attack them in an attempt to wipe them out. this is a historical debate that still goes on. and ultimately, the religion centers around christ, and if he said men and women are equal, and his followers didn't practice that, how does that make the religion sexist, and not simply those followers?
Neutral	to really understand this thought process for "trans activism" they have to believe that it is transphobic to have a preference to not sleep with a trans individual. just because a trans woman is a lesbians doesn't mean that it's really just a man who wants to sleep with lesbians.  gigi gorgeous is most definitely a woman and she is in a lesbian relationship.  most trans women are "straight" though. it only seems to be a handful of trans women who become lesbians.

Neutral	>youtube and google have made it difficult to find anything on their platform      try using a third party search engine with your search limited to results from youtube.com. try adding "site:[URL] to the end of your search on your web search engine of choice. even using google's search engine in this way will give you better results than youtube's native searching on their site, because google.com isn't hooked in to the same specific political filters that youtube.com is. obviously, hard-censored content that's deleted off the platform won't be searchable, but you can still find a lot of good stuff that's still available on the site and just won't show up for any searches.

Neutral	not really. that deeply depends on your own time period and the point that you were looking back at. for example, confucianism taught that the past was more civilised and virtuous than the present. the roman empire is still thought of as a peak of civilised society and a model for the modern world. in fact, the first time i can think of that people began to say that the past was barbaric was in the renaissance.

Neutral	what you might believe to be facts might be considered disinfo by someone else; similarly, their facts are bullshit to you. in that moment, with neither party willing to entertain the info being presented for the sake of discussion, you've reached an impasse.       factor in there are many *skeptics* here, along with agent provocateurs, outright trolls, and paid influencers, offering arguments based on msm scripts and/or beliefs held by the majority in most subs, it calls into question the intent for being here.       it's about being aware of where you are and knowing the audience while also being cognizant that your beliefs might not be received all that warmly. if you want everything to be a debate, this place won't be a great fit as the discussion of theories is an exchange of ideas vs someone or a side winning a debate.       complaining things aren't done right here is subjective and misleading as this place doesn't have a hive mind. contrary to popular opinion, there's very little upon which everyone here agrees is truth. just because people aren't swayed by what's said is irrelevant as the only person your beliefs need to be right for is you.

Neutral	people have such terrible boundaries. if you are a nice person, be nice. if you are mean person, be mean. stop trying to manipulate women into doing what you want. they will make their own decisions, and you can make yours and nobody owes anybody anything unless they have made an agreement to that effect.       not everyone is going to find romantic love in life. if you work on making yourself a better person, you might be more attractive and more well-liked by other people, or maybe you won't be. but of you're doing it because that is the result you want, then you don't really want to be a better person. and you shouldn't be surprised when you fail to get good results. people aren't that stupid, they will eventually figure out whether or not you are being sincere.       this isn't rocket science, you live your life and other people will live theirs. there's more to life than sex and women.

Neutral	the richest and most powerful people in the world have always known that the best way for them to keep their power over you is to tell you "it's all their fault. you could be as rich as i am right now, if it wasn't for the nasty people of [opposite group from you] holding you back and keeping you down. hell, they're probably all as rich as i am right now and they're just keeping it from you because they like seeing you in misery. make no mistake, if they got the chance, they would love to see you and everyone you care about dead. they're the real enemy. we're just trying to help you, and we're doing all we can, but they're just so strong i don't know if we can keep holding them back from getting the chance to destroy you. you have to strike back against them."      then, the people with real power watch as the lower classes' in-fighting makes sure they'll never realize who the real enemy is, because they truly believe the real enemy is their friend.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i use the slur because it goes ahead a singles out the people who aren't going to listen to me anyways. if we can have a valid discussion even after my use of slurs then that means your at least open to my opinion, which saves me time and energy. that's not to say i don't think certain black people are niggers, i do. but i think there is also a not so insignificant amount of black people who want peace and happiness for all. i'd consider them brothers. same applies for all other races.

Neutral	google/alphabet is objectively biased, they've even stated this themselves.      there's dozens of studies about google, alphabet or youtube. it's easy to confirm. tim pool's got a couple of videos about it showing that the majority of recommendations are for liberal videos. conservative videos tend to pull up liberal, neutral or conservative, whereas liberal ones just circle-jerk into mostly more liberal.      that's an aside to demonitization.      also, they've been going after steven crowder and prageru, which i finally got around to watching a little. both are pretty generic conservative and not even remotely alt-right. i figured prageru was some propagandistic shit based upon what people acted like and half of it's economic videos with sourced graphics and charts, like lol. they even go after people like dave rubin, who has 90% liberal videos but dares to talk to the right 10% of the time.

Neutral	> yes, it means incest is not wrong in and of itself, but only as a side-effect of being a power imbalance, and it means relatives who grew up sufficiently apart that they don't have a family power dynamic is morally fine.       sorry, i don't really see where the disconnect is.  this is exactly the point i was trying to make.      i'm saying we think incest is icky because to some extent we are biologically and socially programmed to, but there's really no strong moral argument for it being inherently wrong.

Neutral	today was my best friends birthday party and him and i had been planning it for ages. he was doing paintball but i was just helping him organise it so everyone can have a good time.      we went in the morning and it was great, heaps of fun, 10 of us all best mates. after paintballing we went back to my friends place. we had planned to hang out for the evening in his back yard, with chill music, yummy food and just happy times to celebrate a good blokes birthday.      we were only there together for an hour before everyone disappeared saying they all had things to do. so i hung around with him for the afternoon but it just being us two got kinda boring so i went home. then later on this evening we were playing xbox when we checked snapchat maps. all of the people who we "busy" were all hanging out in the city.      all our "friends" left my best mates 17th to go hang out by themselves. after seeing this we both realised that they had been hiding their plans from us all week. hiding their phones when in group chats just not talking to us about the party. they basically turned up for free paintball (which is expensive!!) and left for themselves.       i am upset because i feel excluded, but i also feel terrible for my friend who tried really hard to make all his friends happy. i think it's so unfair of them to neglect us like that.

Neutral	eh, i think if you want a unified stance of theirs it's that they hate the overt commercialization of the ips.       they didn't really hate on the sequels so much; they found things to criticize because it's their job, but what they don't like is how disney is essentially milking the property for all it's worth. they actually mentioned in one video that -- as much as they don't like how lucas made the movies -- at least lucas was judicious about making them.       likewise for star trek. they don't like how star trek has had to contort itself into the "action" part of the sci-fi genre to try to remain commercially relevant when the earlier television shows could go multiple episodes in a row without a single action scene.      that said, i can't say they're not hypocritical, either. they definitely can be, but also, they let you know constantly that this is all their opinion and you shouldn't take it for more than a subjective take on the current state of the ips.      if anything, watching their best of the worst series has made me much more comfortable enjoying the movies i do, because it highlights the importance of entertainment over everything else.       not to say i can't see where you're coming from, i just thought i'd chip in my $0.02.

Neutral	**context**      this subreddit focuses on the duggars, an american fundamentalist christian family with 19 children from the same parents. this denomination of christianity is extremely strict. most of the women only wear skirts below the knee, the children are homeschooled, and they reject modern music and media. the duggar family had a reality television show called *19 kids and counting*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters. a new show, called *counting on*, focuses on just the adult children and their lives after the scandal. both of the tv shows used to have their own subreddits, but they became mostly inactive.             this subreddit drama focuses on r/duggarssnark, a subreddit created to make snark about the duggar family. however, there has been discussion between members on the subreddit concerning what constitutes snark and what constitutes "leghumping." leghumping is fawning over or praising the duggars, which is not allowed on the sub. some people believe positive observations (ex: her hair looks better than usual) or explaining behavior (ex: is it normal to eat casserole all the time? yes, that is normal in some regions) are forms of leghumping, while other people do not believe so.             **original post**      a regular user posted a meme aimed at leghumpers, people in the comments don't like being characterized as leghumpers, there is a fight about what constitutes leghumping             the user then decides to leave the sub             a different user creates a discussion themed subreddit to supplement the snark subreddit, snark fans tell him to leave             the two main mods (one now deleted) attempt to clarify "leghumping"             a less active mod makes their own post (now deleted) to clarify "leghumping," using a definition that allows positive comments and explaining to be posted. some users object.             the two main mods delete the less active mod's post, and remove that mod             the two main mods make a post to get community feedback, delete post after feedback questions the mods.             as a result of the final thread, one mod deleted their account. the other main mod has yet to respond.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	no state in all of human history has ever escaped poverty by doing what the imf and neoliberal elite told them to do. if china had become a neoliberal state after mao they would still an agricultural society and you'd be talking about the inherently low iq and bad culture of the chinese. jesus christ neoliberals are stupid. the advice of the neoliberals for developing countries is intended to keep them poor, dependent on the west, and sending their resources to the north. that's all it is.      if you want to get rich, you need massive state industry to ensure the state is backed by assets of its own, as well as strict capital controls to keep the global elite from escaping your tax laws and continously moving capital out of the country to the global north. this is exactly what the imf requires countries not to do in order to have access to credit, they always demand that virtually everything not nailed down be sold off, markets opened to foreigners, and all capital controls removed regardless of the fact that it leaves the country dangerously open to massive and disastrous flights of capital on the whims of the intensively bankers.      the west is angry at china because they rejected serfdom and chose freedom for themselves and their people instead.

Neutral	reddit will defend catgirls and even loli cp to the death, but the second furries are brought up, all but the most left-wing subs turn into a far-right "murder all sexual degenerates" circlejerk, to the point where they glorify an actual gas attack:      >[link to article on furry convention gas attack]   >>every generation has its heroes. [+44*]   >>   >>sickens [19 people] as if they're not sickening enough. [+92]      >my guy just pointing guns at people and shit lmao [+320]   >>"people" [+340]      >"these things aren't people" [+82]      you can find such posts and comments on almost any non-left subreddit with a significant amount of subscribers (not even going to get into the cesspools that are dedicated furry hate subs). someone will inevitably create a "meme" with some about shooting furries, because of course they will, and every time the circlejerk is reinforced and validated in the post's comments. i can't think of any other time where mods have to remove as many *(highly upvoted!)* comments as they do when furries are mentioned. reddit loves to hate hate hate, but a lot of of them aren't brave enough to hate on actual minorities. they risk a slight chance of backlash. so instead they choose the next best thing, an easier alternative that won't *(can't)* fight back. all the feelings of superiority of hating gays or brown people, but with none of the guilt or backlash! **bonus**: most furries are bi and gay, le epic win xd!      "it's all ironic bro! it's just jokes!" reddit's classic excuse to get away with saying anything. "edgy jokes" is their only excuse. yes, the tens of thousands of highly-upvoted comments across reddit calling for shootings, gassings, dehumanization and actual threats? all just a prank bro. something is going to happen one day (well, happen *again*, remember a gassing already did) when another person is radicalized, probably a shooting, and they're going to deny any responsibility whatsoever. and then reddit will go back to business as usual, repeat ad infinitum.

Neutral	edit: apparently i may have been mistaken.         ~~even ignoring the absurd amounts, he also misses the fact that "protein" isn't actually a single unified nutrient. there's a whole bunch of different amino acids, some of which can only be gained from dietary sources.~~      ~~for non vegetarians, this is pretty easy to fulfill, as most (i think all, but am not certain) meat is a complete source of protein. from plant sources, most will only give you some of the ones you need (soy being an exception). historically, many societies have gravitated to a set of staple vegetables that will provide a complete set when eaten together. oftentimes a bean of some sort along side a grain such as wheat or rice.~~      ~~in practice, it isn't super hard to get a complete set, but an unbalanced diet heavy on one plant to the exclusion of others is almost certain to be deficient. i'm not sure what lettuce is missing, but it's almost certainly lacking some of the essential amino acids.~~

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of minecraft's official release, i have decided to type this open letter to the mojang staff, in the hopes that notch (who, despite being a moderator, i am not allowed to ping) might relay it to a mojang employee or group of employees who he may still be in contact with (i could email it to them, but i doubt anyone would ever read it), however the sale of the company may have negatively impacted their relationship. here is the letter:      dear mojang,      i am [USER], a devoted fan of your game and active player on the official minecraft of the subreddit that your own founder - who, if you are reading this message, most likely sent it to you - moderates. though you have probably not heard of me, i have found it necessary to type this letter. i have been an avid admirer of and participant in your game, minecraft, for many years. i have made great memories and developed useful skills in my escapades on both my singleplayer worlds and on various servers. i have played and made adventures maps. i was a devoted follower of many of the classic minecraft youtubers. i give sole credit to this game for my interest in engineering and in applied physics. it is because of the devotion of people such as myself that your game became the most successful the world has ever seen. indeed, it is because i appreciate your game that i am so greatly distressed by its current direction, specifically by how it exposes your hypocrisy, apathy, unethical and potentially even illegal behavior, and contempt for the minecraft community. to illustrate this point, i really could analyze any recent update, but i've decided to focus on 1.14 in particular. though this letter's structure may seem disorganized, and its contents irrelevant, i hope that it, harnessing your piercing intellects, will be able to illuminate the problems of such aspects of the current state of your game as those of you who still have consciences have ignored. i will of course not comment on every last change or addition made in the update, and i will barely acknowledge the positive changes because, frankly, they are almost all very subtle and long overdue. now, without adieu:      playing through the latest update, i was struck by your hypocritical design philosophy. i noticed two particular examples of this; i will begin with the more benign (which i feel is probably the result of apathy), and then discuss the far more sinister one. the more harmless example is the new stonecutter block, whose model features a sawblade. you have rejected many suggested features (rightly, in my opinion), such as mining hats, for "not fitting with the medieval theme of minecraft". why then did you add this? however, this issue is massively overshadowed by another; a new mob you added to the game is the fox. as an ambient mob, i quite like the fox. that said, i strongly object to the ability to take foxes. foxes are frequently kept as pets, which causes them to live out depressing and anxious lives, as they, of course, are not domesticated animals. why would you encourage children and even clueless adults to participate in this incredibly inhumane enterprise, especially considering that you yourselves removed the ability to tame parrots by feeding them cookies out of a concern for the wellbeing of parrots, and in this very update removed polar bears from the list of mobs required for the monsters hunted advancement? i can assume only that you have some financial interest in promoting the wild fox pet trade, which, if true, is quite disappointing.      the new update makes many changes to villagers and villagers, both by redesigning villagers and by adding a new mob: the pillager. as you are without a doubt aware of the changes, i will not bother to list them all here. i appreciate many of the quality-of-life changes to villagers, and i can tolerate the changes to villager profession selection (though it complicates some of my challenge maps); i take issue only with the changes to villager appearance. i admit that my objections are not wholly rational, but i wish there they retained their classic appearance in at least one biome. at any rate, the other visual changes surpass them in both consequence and malice. with regard to villagers, i take greater issue with pillagers.      i must admit that pillagers seem halfhearted. from the beginning, i was skeptical of "raider villagers", but i thought the idea might work as long as the raids didn't happen automatically without possibility of prevention (and indeed, they do not). however, i think there was a missed opportunity to make pillagers a new kind of villager rather than a new kind of illager. if they were villagers, they would be neutral to the player by default and players would potentially have the ability to ally themselves with them. in this case, they would also be mutually-hostile with zombies. you might say that you couldn't promote raiding in a children's game, but by the very design of minecraft, the player is able to do heinously evil things; for example, it is possible to directly burn child villagers to death if you like. therefore, i don't see how joining raider gangs would be much worse. you could even make the gangs take over settlements instead of indiscriminately slaughtering everyone (except the children, who can prolong a raid by several minutes as the pillagers wait for them to grow up so they can kill them, which could have been solved if you made them kidnap to raise them as pillagers) make it seem better. as it stands now, however, pillagers are simply a new enemy. while adding new enemies isn't inherently bad, i feel you could have done more. lastly, it should be possible to exterminate pillagers from an area. pillager patrols should spawn only if there is an active outpost in the area, and the pillagers in an outpost should have to rebuild their population by breeding or by raising kidnapped baby villagers. in the current version of your game, there is no way to eliminate organized crime if you try to create a civilization encompassing multiple settlements, and, since pillagers are automatically hostile, no way to travel without being attacked.      in addition to these things, you've added a new villager-like mob; the wandering trader. though i admire its advanced ai and complex behavior, it should not have been added to the game. all it does is sell the player biome-specific items, which, since it always spawns near a player, eliminates the incentive to explore, a major and lauded feature of your game. i cannot imagine you really thought this would "help" players who didn't want to explore for resources; creative mode and commands exist for that. the only way it could conceivably be useful is on a large anarchy server where all resources within large areas have been depleted. however, because it always spawns next to a player, and there is a cap of one per world at a specific time, most players will never see it on a large server.      now i would like to briefly comment on another new mob: the panda. i would find it quite peculiar that you spent valuable time making them one of the most complex mobs in the history of the game, having sets of alleles that combine to manifest as varying phenotypes, when they have practically no function, the only practical function, so far as i can see, is collecting slimeballs in peaceful difficulty (baby pandas sometimes sneeze in a reference to the long-dead internet meme and drop slimeballs as a result). however, i do not, for i believe i have the depressing answer; the people's republic of china. you would be far from the first corporation to pander to china at the cost of the immediate value of your own property. the prc is infamous for its use of "panda diplomacy" to improve its international image; i have to wonder if they worked out an arrangement with to ease their restrictions on minecraft (which isn't outright illegal) in exchange with cooperation with this agenda.      the previous supporting paragraphs have avoiding directly addressing one of the most controversial and damning elements of the new update; the texture changes. in this paragraph, i will address it, along with another, comparatively minor, change. to the shock of many, you took it upon yourselves to completely redesign every last texture in the game (except for that of the creeper, which is preserved for being "iconic"). yes, you did not make them the default (though you plan to from the next update onward), and currently have no public intention of making them mandatory without mods. nevertheless, they are a window into your future plans for the game. it is obvious what you hope to achieve by changing the textures (with seemingly no support) from their iconic classic designs (which is so ubiquitous that most people can probably picture them in their head on command) to generic ones that, if i may be honest, make minecraft look like a free-to-play mobile knockoff of itself. you want to make minecraft into a bland, mobile-style game that any five-year old can pick up and play with for hours doing nothing of value. if the game's character, colored with the heart and soul poured into by its creators and which reflects the neurodiverse individuals who finally found an outlet in it, must die for this, then so be it. when you have had your way, minecraft will no longer by a life-redefining experience that inspires those pushed to the edge by society to achieve greatness, it will no longer by a game in which thousands make creative and challenging puzzles and adventures for everyone to enjoy, it will no longer be a game that inspires artists and engineers; it will be game where children build models of penis out of tnt and laugh as they blow them up. to this end, you have redesigned the textures, simplified the game, and even changed the dye system, because usually ground-up bones for white dye apparently gave the game too much personality. you have made your contempt for the neurodiverse no secret; you even condescendingly renamed the classic textures to "programmer art". its blatancy would be laughable if it wasn't so appalling.      with all that said, i should stress that your game is not beyond saving. if you wish to take my advice to heart, you must remove the sawblade from the stonecutter's texture and the ability to tame foxes (but may keep them as an ambient mob), make player-pillager relations more dynamic, remove the wandering trader, cut any illicit ties you may have formed with repressive regimes, and, last but not least, reverse the trend of "simplifying" the game. thank you for reading this letter. i look forward to hearing from you in the future.      cordially,      [USER]

Neutral	which isn't to say that developers "should" include easy modes in games, but i think it's entirely appropriate for a review to report their subjective experience that a game's difficulty negatively impacted their ability to enjoy the game.       reddit's "git gud" insistence boils back to elitism. reddit loves to criticize games for being too easy, but if you criticize a game for being too hard, reddit pulls out all the stops to talk about authorial intent, and how not all games need to appeal to all people.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	this reddit post has put into words what i have been thinking lately at night.       [URL]             i have a sister who passed away a few years ago in her mid 50's...never married, never having children. she was physically disabled with a birth defect, although she had a college degree and was mostly independent. but she never dated, never had relationships. she was extremely lonely and isolated. she was in so much physical pain as well, and was completely addicted to pain medication. (oxycontin, etc) this is after a lifetime of surgeries (over 75-80 of them) and hospital stays. unlike most with severe mental disabilities, my sister knew how screwed up her life was. she hated it. she contemplated suicide several times. she had to be on antidepressants, go through therapy. i can't even imagine what would have happened to her if she had been born to a family who couldn't have afforded the best for her.               the point of all of this is this. as a sister of a loved one who had to call life and death....literally...3 times for my sister's life and watch her go through hell and back, there is no way in hell i would ever not abort a fetus if i found out my baby had the same disability. and yes, we had to screen carefully when i was pregnant as i have 2 siblings with this disability. (the other sibling died as an infant) i live in a state passing a heartbeat law, and it pisses me off to no end that these religious political zealots put no value on the quality of life. i would never want any loved one of mine going through what my sister went through.              i have family members who post shit on facebook every day, praising these new laws. i want to smack them, or call them out. these are the same damn family members who didn't visit my sister ever when she needed them most.              i miss her every, single day. and i'm so grateful she has found peace now.

Neutral	to be fair, you should never expect a cat that's not yours to be friendly.      they are the exception.      the owner could just be badly caring for the animal, like another comment said.       you did say you're going through a rough time, as if it's relevant to your opinion of cats. in that case, wait for when you're in a calmer moment of life to define your proper opinion on cats.      i like dogs, i wouldn't own one because of how much more care they need than cats, and because they frankly disturb me with how happy they are. because i know humans have conditioned them into it. it's messed up. i feel like cats are way more genuine.      tell you what. if you really care about defining a solid opinion on this, adopt a kitty, take care of it.       there'll be an adaptive phase of some weeks, but afterwards, they're probably not gonna act violently towards you. if an animal grows with their owner they're gonna have a certain bond with them. i know it was the case with my cat.      after you do this, you're guaranteed to form a proper opinion. i say proper because i believe you haven't gotten to see the good side of them.

PersonDirectedAbuse	for starters, this website has a huge compilation of writing about why bernie poses a real threat to american politics.  there's tons of article in there, but if you only have time for two, i'd recommend reading this article about his racism and this one about the role misogyny has played in his success. the gist of both is that he sees class issues as infinitely more important than systemic racism and misogyny. when he cautions against "identity politics", he's appealing to whites and men in the democratic party or on the left in general who are scared of the mainstream political discussion on the left being centered about women and poc. but seriously, there's probably hundreds of article in that compilation, and every one i've read has been great, so i'd recommend reading as many as possible.
Neutral	i feel like you misunderstood what i'm saying. it's not about being them being"shallow", it's about them being able to accept that this illness isn't something they have any control over. they can't stop it, they can't correct it, they can only support their partner and accept them as they are. you can genuinely love someone and still leave them for your own mental health. dealing with a partner who's always sick is tough, it wears a person down over time.      plus theres always going to be another girl who doesn't have those problems. the alternative option is always there.       or they could just be alone.      both options would be a lot easier. for a lot of people, those options are better for that reason alone. it beats feeling the helplessness, the never ending frustration that come with loving someone you can't always protect.
Neutral	[URL]         the momo challenge wasn't real then, and it isn't real now. youtube confirmed that, contrary to press reports, it hasn't seen any evidence of videos showing or promoting the "momo challenge" on its platform. if the videos did exist, a spokesperson for youtube said, they would be removed instantly for violating the platform's policies. additionally, there have been zero corroborated reports of any child ever taking his or her own life after participating in this phony challenge.         all of these challenges and trends follow the same formula: a local news station runs a piece overstating a dangerous teen trend. concerned parents flock to social media to spread the word. actual teenagers and anyone else who lives their life extremely online mock them for their naïveté. brands and influencers hop on the trend, parodying it and exploiting it for their own gain. and trolls take advantage of those who believe it's real, often by creating and posting content that seemingly confirms parents' worst fears. snl brilliantly parodied this cycle in 2010. since then, it has only gotten worse.         worried parents share these hoax stories relentlessly on facebook, twitter, and instagram. they beg the platforms themselves to do something to fix the mess. many parents believe that spreading awareness about the latest dangerous craze will help kids stay safe, but they could very well be doing the opposite.         the problem is, these stories are only ever a distraction. they offer false reassurance and an easy fix to the wrong problem. if you can protect your child from the momo challenge, the thinking goes, you can protect them from bad things on the internet. unfortunately, maintaining kids' safety online is a much more complicated and delicate task. "this whole 'momo is making kids commit suicide' is a digital version of playing beatles records backwards to hear satanic messages," says ben collins, a journalist who covers misinformation. "it does a real disservice to all the harmful stuff targeting children and teens on youtube."

Neutral	ffs, its the law. redactions must be done, and their fallen hero, mueller, is assisting barr with this.      [URL]      (e) recording and disclosing the proceedings.      (1) recording the proceedings. except while the grand jury is deliberating or voting, all proceedings must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device. but the validity of a prosecution is not affected by the unintentional failure to make a recording. unless the court orders otherwise, an attorney for the government will retain control of the recording, the reporter's notes, and any transcript prepared from those notes.      (2) secrecy.      (a) no obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with rule 6(e)(2)(b).      (b) unless these rules provide otherwise, the following persons must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury:      (i) a grand juror;      (ii) an interpreter;      (iii) a court reporter;      (iv) an operator of a recording device;      (v) a person who transcribes recorded testimony;      (vi) an attorney for the government; or      (vii) a person to whom disclosure is made under rule 6(e)(3)(a)(ii) or (iii).      (3) exceptions.      (a) disclosure of a grand-jury matter—other than the grand jury's deliberations or any grand juror's vote—may be made to:      (i) an attorney for the government for use in performing that attorney's duty;      (ii) any government personnel—including those of a state, state subdivision, indian tribe, or foreign government—that an attorney for the government considers necessary to assist in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law; or      (iii) a person authorized by 18 u.s.c. §3322.      (b) a person to whom information is disclosed under rule 6(e)(3)(a)(ii) may use that information only to assist an attorney for the government in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law. an attorney for the government must promptly provide the court that impaneled the grand jury with the names of all persons to whom a disclosure has been made, and must certify that the attorney has advised those persons of their obligation of secrecy under this rule.      (c) an attorney for the government may disclose any grand-jury matter to another federal grand jury.      (d) an attorney for the government may disclose any grand-jury matter involving foreign intelligence, counterintelligence (as defined in 50 u.s.c. §401a3003), or foreign intelligence information (as defined in rule 6(e)(3)(d)(iii)) to any federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration, national defense, or national security official to assist the official receiving the information in the performance of that official's duties. an attorney for the government may also disclose any grand-jury matter involving, within the united states or elsewhere, a threat of attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or its agent, a threat of domestic or international sabotage or terrorism, or clandestine intelligence gathering activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by its agent, to any appropriate federal, state, state subdivision, indian tribal, or foreign government official, for the purpose of preventing or responding to such threat or activities.      (i) any official who receives information under rule 6(e)(3)(d) may use the information only as necessary in the conduct of that person's official duties subject to any limitations on the unauthorized disclosure of such information. any state, state subdivision, indian tribal, or foreign government official who receives information under rule 6(e)(3)(d) may use the information only in a manner consistent with any guidelines issued by the attorney general and the director of national intelligence.      (ii) within a reasonable time after disclosure is made underrule 6(e)(3)(d), an attorney for the government must file, under seal, a notice with the court in the district where the grand jury convened stating that such information was disclosed and the departments, agencies, or entities to which the disclosure was made.      (iii) as used in rule 6(e)(3)(d), the term "foreign intelligence information" means:      (a) information, whether or not it concerns a united states person, that relates to the ability of the united states to protect against—      • actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or its agent;      • sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power or its agent; or      • clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by its agent; or      (b) information, whether or not it concerns a united states person, with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to—      • the national defense or the security of the united states; or      • the conduct of the foreign affairs of the united states.      (e) the court may authorize disclosure—at a time, in a manner, and subject to any other conditions that it directs—of a grand-jury matter:      (i) preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding;      (ii) at the request of a defendant who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury;      (iii) at the request of the government, when sought by a foreign court or prosecutor for use in an official criminal investigation;      (iv) at the request of the government if it shows that the matter may disclose a violation of state, indian tribal, or foreign criminal law, as long as the disclosure is to an appropriate state, state-subdivision, indian tribal, or foreign government official for the purpose of enforcing that law; or      (v) at the request of the government if it shows that the matter may disclose a violation of military criminal law under the uniform code of military justice, as long as the disclosure is to an appropriate military official for the purpose of enforcing that law.      (f) a petition to disclose a grand-jury matter under rule 6(e)(3)(e)(i) must be filed in the district where the grand jury convened. unless the hearing is ex parte—as it may be when the government is the petitioner—the petitioner must serve the petition on, and the court must afford a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard to:      (i) an attorney for the government;      (ii) the parties to the judicial proceeding; and      (iii) any other person whom the court may designate.      (g) if the petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district, the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court unless the petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper. if the petitioned court decides to transfer, it must send to the transferee court the material sought to be disclosed, if feasible, and a written evaluation of the need for continued grand-jury secrecy. the transferee court must afford those persons identified in rule 6(e)(3)(f) a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard.      (4) sealed indictment. the magistrate judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pending trial. the clerk must then seal the indictment, and no person may disclose the indictment's existence except as necessary to issue or execute a warrant or summons.      (5) closed hearing. subject to any right to an open hearing in a contempt proceeding, the court must close any hearing to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.      (6) sealed records. records, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand-jury proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.      (7) contempt. a knowing violation of rule 6, or of any guidelines jointly issued by the attorney general and the director of national intelligence under rule 6, may be punished as a contempt of court.

Neutral	you are both wrong. there is one power in control of both central, south, and north america. this power depends on you hating your brothers to the south and having them hate you, and having some of your neighbors hate themselves.       us americans don't enjoy prosperity. you don't enjoy what "die-hard liberals" tell you, you don't enjoy watching strangers enter what you see as your home. you live in fear that you are the last on the list of priorities. there is a new path, where you can put yourself first, and really start to enjoy the gifts that you have been given.       i understand you may not get me, and my words may fail. but there is another way of viewing your gifts. our ancestors called this "indian giving." but this was a cultural failure to understand wise people who understood that gifts are not things to be hoarded but to be passed on.       the settlers did not understand the ways of life of those who had practiced living in this land for an extremely long time. it is so immature to think because you have the nice toys, that you are somehow better than the poor kid on the other side of the tracks.       the spoiled trust fund child who is handed a ferrari at 16 does not have more wisdom than the poor kid who spends his childhood learning to play guitar. one can become a rock star, the other may end up around a tree.       you should not be motivated by guilt, you are a victim of the same deep state that ruined their country and sent them to your backyard for you to pay for them. they are your brothers, and you share a common enemy.       america has a chance to be a light unto the world, a city on a hill that shall not be hidden, but if you hide your light under your bushel, or behind a wall, it will go out.

Neutral	we first got the internet in our house in 1998; i was 12. the first website i visited was theforce.net; the second was a porn site. i'd already discovered masturbation a year prior but unfettered web access blew the doors off the whole fucking thing. as a shy and introverted kid, who'd been relentlessly teased by girls in middle school and junior high and had learned to fear them, and who was now going to an all boys high school, it was a godsend for my raging, gooey hormones. i didn't have to worry about girls anymore! everything i knew about naked girls in my teenage years, i learned from the internet. it felt like the perfect — and safe — release valve. it was also a prime enabler of avoidance of girls, and of never needing to confront the reality that not all girls were going to make fun of me. my grades never suffered, and i did have friends, but i was pretty well in the internet porn bubble by 15.      around then, my porn tastes had expanded from merely jacking to pictures of naked women and low quality video clips to reading erotica. lots of it. literotica was a wonderland for me. i also got to indulge my curiosity in gay porn, and i found the sheer novelty of it to be breathtakingly exciting. i mixed it in with all the opposite-sex porn i was consuming i began a long period of questioning my sexuality, even though being surrounded by guys all day, i never felt attracted or infatuated to a single one of them. it never occurred to me at 16 and 17 that i was responding to the novelty and the taboo of watching gay porn, and that it did not align with my own sexual preferences. soon after i graduated from high school, i decided to put it to the test — i found a guy my age who lived nearby, and i actually lost my virginity to him. it did not do a damn thing for me, and i came away confident that i wasn't gay, but the porn consumption continued.       i didn't date at all from 17 to 20. i'd had my first girlfriend during high school and it was very exciting in a physical sense, thereby proving that i was still very much attracted to girls, but that had long since ended and i retreated into my shell of depression/anxiety and enough porn to suffocate a lesser man. high speed internet had come into our home, so now there was more porn, and it was *faster!* now there were streaming sites; xtube was an early favorite of mine. it was so comforting and reliable, and it never made me feel anxious; ashamed, but never anxious.       i starting dating my first real girlfriend when i was 20, and she was the first time i'd ever had sex with a woman, and the first time i'd had sex at all since that one guy i'd experimented with. i enjoyed sex with her but was still pretty anxious and inhibited about not living up to the dudes i'd watched in pornos, both professional and amateur. this led to a lot of performance anxiety, and using masturbation as a self-soothing mechanism, it gave rise to erectile dysfunction as well. erectile dysfunction at 21 years old. can you fucking believe it? it was a source of tension in the relationship, amongst other things — namely my untreated anxiety and depression, which i didn't want to accept and face. my porn consumption bothered her as well. long story short, we lasted two years before the entire relationship deteriorated. this did nothing to improve my self-esteem.      over the next decade, i went on a ton of first dates that went nowhere, and had a handful of one-night stands where i could force myself to perform (at least) adequately. entire days, nights, and weekends would be consumed by porn — streaming videos, pictures, literary erotica, and once i found reddit, a ton of the gonewild-type subs. i'd be masturbating four or five times a day when i was alone. it would leave me feeling drained and utterly revolted by myself. my socialization dropped like a rock as a result of intense anxiety, and the excessive masturbation was being used as an avoidance mechanism to hold the anxiety at bay. it was all a terribly dysfunctional cycle.       a few months ago, the woman of my dreams, whom i'd been dating for over a year, left me for reasons unrelated to my masturbation habits. it broke me, and i'm now finally getting therapy for the anxiety that has held my life in a death grip since adolescence. and now, it's time to leave masturbation behind too. i've masturbated five times in the last twenty-four hours due to obvious anxiety issues and i cannot stand it anymore. i'm feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself for the last time. i'm going to get better, and goddammit i'm going to pursue the type of life and relationships i deserve. this cannot be anymore. my life cannot be crippled by anxiety and its toxic coping mechanisms any longer. no more porn. no more gonewild subs. no nothing. the next time i see a naked woman is gonna be when she's standing right in front of me, however long it takes.       i'm done jerking myself into a coma, just like i'm done hiding from the world. i don't deserve to be treated this way *by my own self*, let alone anybody else. my mission to improve my life has gained a new facet and an extra shot in the arm. telling my story on a public forum such as this is my way of owing it and drawing the dividing line between the past and the future. thanks for reading.      tl;dr: masturbated daily for twenty two years, used it as a crutch to avoid my anxiety, ran my social life into the ground, but fuck both of those things now. i'm in therapy and i'm gonna go out there and get mine.

Neutral	the thing about genocide though, is that it starts out small. the germans didn't wake up one day and say "you know what, let's kill all these people we don't consider to be real europeans". it started with centuries long hate, followed by pseudo science and rationalization, and ended in one of the worst genocides the world has ever seen. when people promote, condone, rationalize, or try to commit genocide we as a society need to nip that in the bud long before it becomes an actual problem. i don't think we're at the point where we need to worry about a white genocide and i think the people who say so are over exagerating, but i can understand why they are concerned about the possibility.

Neutral	i'm also a chubby guy who is socially awkward and afraid to talk to girls.       i went on my first date at 19 i liked her all through high school. it just took me all those years to build up the courage to ask her out.       second date at 21 (different girl)       had my first relationship at 22 (long distance)(different girl)       second relationship at 24. (long distance again)       first kiss at 25.      currently engaged in my second relationship. i'm 26 now.       there are guys who go on dates every weekend and that works for them, but that doesn't mean it's the only way. you can find something else that works for you.       don't let society place time limits where they don't exist. be persistent, but patient.

Neutral	these are not the words of an unbiased mod, they're the words of an arsehole., the [USER] mods try to introduce some new rules but the users are having none of it.
Neutral	there's a whole lot of the second camp than there are the first
Neutral	yeah, i agree with most of the content here, but the tone makes my teeth fucking grind. fuck off with that cutesy, passive-aggressive bullshit.
Neutral	the dumbest part imo is that the fallacy fallacy exists to basically dismantle most of these stupid arguments. an argument doing something fallacious doesn't mean the opposite side is automatically correct, you can totally argue a right point in the worst way possible but that doesn't discount the better arguments for the same conclusion.
Neutral	the system we have is pretty obviously broken,  but the "solutions" the left usually puts through would only make shit worse. i personally like to see a private/public system tried. anyways, national single payer healthcare would be a total disaster.
Neutral	aren't there specific rules for public subreddits specifically to prevent the       >this is our subreddit. participation here is a privilege and not a right.          kinda reaction?

Neutral	*enh?* i know there are *ways* to make your life easier in soulsborne. thanks to a friend's suggestion i rolled with a sorceress for a while, and that got me the furthest i ever got (up to duke's archives). but the game still relies on fast reactions and stuff, which means even the "easy" builds are still too tough for me.      i lost interest almost two years ago, tbh. just watched a let's play for the story content.       still bitter that i couldn't get to play around with them fancy armours, because i love me some costumes and playing fashion plate with videogames, and the souls games are beautiful for that. but oh well.
Neutral	would you like to join our cause?
Neutral	with that reasoning is there then ever a logical reason to do anything? if life is just suffering and not worth living, shouldn't we all just kill ourselves?

Neutral	hi. i'm just a really normal reddit user. i don't do anything fanatical and stay mostly in my tv show subreddits. but every now and then i have a morbid curiosity. i don't like that people die, but they do. sometimes i just want to watch it. reddit was a safe place for me to watch people die. i have no interest in 4/8-chan because of the culture. watch people die was moderated by good people. the jokes were good there. it was under control, it wasn't the same internet cesspool that similar subject matter is plagued by.              i guess i just wanted to say i miss, r/watchpeopledie. it may have not meant much to others, but to me it was a great community.
Neutral	is it untrue? or is your bais with fox?
Neutral	it definitely is a fairly common theme
Neutral	thats pretty normal its just so that you cant evade bans. not sure how much admins enforce that though.
Neutral	>my main chemical/biological/emotional need other than food and water is physical contact with beautiful girls and the lack of that in my life has been really torturous and destructive for me,       hey! look at me! i'm sitting here sad and lonely!      without a fire, but a desire to not hear you say, "i have a boyfriend!"      and i see da ladies walking along one by one, and i never wanna hear, "i have a boyfriend!"      tell me why i'm stuck as a virgin with rage! tell me why i so need a cute girl my age! tell me why i never wanna hear you say, "i have a boyfriend!"     
Neutral	reddit is a private property, that mean it's owners get to decide who stays on it and who doesn't. people have to understand that free speech doesn't mean that others have to listen to it on their private 'property'.
Neutral	yeah i feel for this too good shit too. 100$ cheeper rent (in a fucking expensive area) cool. moved in like 2 days ago and fucking roaches. not infestation levels, but i can kill like 6 a night ez.
Neutral	clearly they're just greedy doctors who want to make more money instead of being my slave and giving me free healthcare
Neutral	ya think so? as of right now, i handle almost the entirety of projects and get maybe 10% of the cut. even if i'm significantly less busy i might still end up netting more since i'm getting 100%.
Neutral	what exactly am i looking at in the second link?

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	even so called "normal" incels come off as insanely entitled. just call yourself "lonely" like a normal person. not everyone is gonna fuck and that's ok. you are not entitled to sex.        build up a normal, healthy relationship, then focus on sex.

Neutral	usually, l-slur-toids are too pansy-ass to allow any kind of comedy ("you perpetuated a stereotype reeeeeee") and r-slur-toid "jokes" are just too angry to actually be funny ("i'd nuke the j-slurs to save the w-slur race, but (((cockroaches))) survive *everything* lmao"). humor lives in the center.      i never would have picked manlet shapiro to be the guy who dialed it back the right amount to be hilarious.

Neutral	its disrespectful to larp as something you are not.
Neutral	liking brands is not a substitute for a personality, and box office money =/= quality      i remember when "nerd culture," such as it was, was filled with creative, clever people who loved diying stuff. it was fun because parts of it felt like an excitingly non-commercial space. now it just refers to what franchises you engage with.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	vic2 > ck2      let's you violently repress political radicals and racial minorities while building the chaddest empire in the world, or alternatively build a centrist utopia in the americas for all the people to stream to.      one interesting strategy, for example, is to direct immigration (should you be recieve enough) to areas with rebellious cultures. the immigrants will slowly outnumber the natives and then assimilate to your proper culture destroying the native homeland.

Neutral	**cyclists need to be aware on the road**      i learned to ride a motorcycle. this is something that is not really mentioned but is wholly related. obviously, cars are a huge risk to those who ride a motorcycle for the same reasons cyclists.      what you're taught as a motorbike rider, the most important lesson, is that you're responsible for you. you cannot rely on a driver to be looking out for you. not because they don't want to but because, like cyclists, you're less visible. cars have blind spots and you can't expect them to always see you.      the second most valuable lesson is that motorcyclists tend to make better drivers because they're more aware on the road and responsible for their driving decisions. they're more concerned about reacting to other drivers decisions rather than driving on autopilot and going, "oopsie" when something unexpected happens.       being aware of your surroundings as a cyclist or motorcyclist is still essential to safety.             **cyclists need to be aware on footpaths (sidewalks)**      a car is predictable. in most cases, a car will be on the road. unless it's pulling out of a driveway it's very rare to see a car that isn't on the road and it's impossible to see a road and not know that a motor-vehicle will use that road. driving has rules. you stick to the designated areas and should there be any reason to be where a pedestrian might walk you look and wait for any to pass.       the same isn't said for footpaths (or sidewalks i think it's called where you are), bike tracks and cyclists.      this is the case in many places here that both footpaths and bike tracks are shared by pedestrians and cyclists. it doesn't make sense to me either but basically, there are footpaths that just end in bike tracks and force pedestrians to use the bike track to get from point a to b. this usually isn't a big problem and pedestrians on a bike track are automatically more aware of the possibility of a cyclist. (if ever a reason to have ***more*** bike tracks exists, this is not a bad one at all)      the problem is the unpredictability of cyclists and a lack of presence.       a cyclist, here at least, is in no way predictable. a pedestrian will use a footpath, a car will use a road and a cyclist will use whatever is convenient at the time. with a lack of presence, it's impossible to know if you'll even see a cyclist on that day. together you end up with both drivers and pedestrians not being able to anticipate if or when a cyclist is going to be there or how they're going to behave. this means a cyclist has to be more aware of their surroundings than the pedestrian as the pedestrian has no way of knowing how to react even when aware of the cyclist due to the unpredictability of the situation. in my experience with cyclists, there is no definitive answer to "how do i avoid a pedestrian". some move to one side of the footpath, some ride on the road, some ring their bell so you can move out of their way and some creepily follow behind at a slow pace without ringing their bell until you notice and step out of their way like they expect you to be psychic or something. that last category is the jerks.       unlike with cars, there isn't some set rule that applies to all cyclists and pedestrians and unlike bike tracks, you can't stay aware of things you're unlikely to encounter.      the solution to this is actually having more bike tracks and cyclists rather than less.             i overthought the ***fuck*** out of this and strayed way beyond the original point of the thread.
Neutral	> can this even be real??      no, it's not real. unfortunately the media is here to generate clicks and "17 y/o legally euthanised" will get a lot of clicks. how can this country think this is okay, and such. they sprinkle on some extra lies such as there are no insitutions where teenagers can get help.      in reality she was denied euthanasia for being too young. so she starved herself. she tried before and her parents got a court order for involuntary feeding and treatment in a clinic. this time they decided not to forcefeed her, and instead let her go through with it. you can read about it in dutch press. i guess as a parent seeing your child suffer, and after forcing her to stay alive before, they couldn't do it again. it's a very shitty and sad situation, and it's despicable that the international press has used it for a quick buck in the way that it has.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i think that in itself isn't something you should be shamed for. like if we were to flip the situation around, and asked the question of whether it's okay to call the victim of an assault a slut, we meet with a resounding no, because it didn't happen by choice. i think it's lazy to make fun of someone for something they didn't choose. plus, if someone is a virgin because they refuse to shower or are a huge asshole, it's way more productive to make fun of those behaviours, not the result. and if someone is just struggling to meet/chat up someone of their desired gender, why would you mock them for that?      *however*.      if someone is like, a self-identified incel, and they've taken their virginity to be some kind of symptom of a systemic problem with the opposite sex, then they're getting into territory where i'm okay with making fun of them (although even then i tend to feel more sympathy than humour in the situation). and i'd make more fun of them for believing the world is 'chad and stacey' than anything else.

Neutral	that's a nice sentiment, but what happens to us as children will impact us for the rest of our lives. i don't think anyone is consciously picking and choosing what effects them. if your worth is met with repulsion when you are young, it makes sense you have a very poor self esteem.       not to mention, if someone treats you that way, it's usually not just a one time event. it's probably happening all through your childhood from both sexes (as well as other tactics to make you feel worthless).       now, that doesn't justify bad behavior but it does mean i cant have empathy.       the idea that "oh it happened when they were 12, so it doesn't matter" seems pretty dismissive.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	[USER] got quarantined a long time ago. somehow an endless fit was not thrown over it though in billionaire funded right wing propaganda journals. the left is censored all the time, in fact i'd say it's far more extreme than anything extended to the right. the right just views itself as the sole legitimate political view in america and is furious than open white supremacy isn't tolerated anymore at the same time that anything to the right of hitler is allowed to exist.      of course the first response of liberal idiots after this is to seek to find a leftist scalp to make everything 'fair'. literally a moment cannot pass without us being stabbed in the back by liberals so that they can do some moralistic both sides garbage. and afterwards the right just literally spits at them in the face, like it never once in history has satisfied the right. the appeasement doesn't make them any happier or more grateful to the idiot liberals, it just becomes another tool in their box they can use in their attempt to destroy humanity. and then of course they stick their nose down to their ass and sniff deeply and boast about how 'fair they were' when though they're 'a progressive too'.       do the idiot liberals care? no. because they are fucking cucks incapable of anything. if there were five rightists and a billion liberals, the nation would inevitably become the successor to nazi germany. liberalism is the ideology of weakness, it knows no strategy but appeasement.      unlike the rightists though, we will not run to our billionaires and massive propaganda machine and whine and cry endlessly. we will continue on unphased, we will organize. until victory, always. we do not consider ourselves entitled to the world, we know we have to fight for it. we are used to setbacks and betrayal, a liberal cannot breathe without betraying.

Neutral	sure, but you should also read through my comment history. large subs of what i noticed, the top mods all seem to have the same back ground which is market research and brand managing. when you look through the threads characteristics of certain users always stand out. the pattern of each of these accounts is the name itself, which all they are is just brands for sites for products to buy, or bought accounts.   so it's either someone running many accounts at once or just bots.

Neutral	some years ago laci greene made a video all about how important it is to trust the victim.      i'm still waiting for the many thousands of people who were brave enough to admit, in the comments, that laci greene had raped them to receive the attention and support they deserve.      the **reality** is that **everyone** who goes into toxic-overdrive (and it is toxic)  when accusations are leveled only do so because it panders to their biases.      now that smollett has been charged i can say that there was nothing **remotely** credible about his claims. it was possible that what he said had happened, but extremely unlikely.      anyone who immediately believed him was, at best, a credulous fool. and at worst they were bigoted pieces of shit who just loved the opportunity to spread more hate.

Neutral	this in particular was the drama i wanted to post about because it sparked a rather intense discussion about what was acceptable and what wasn't. the whole argument that it was interfering with the girls ability to obtain autonomy was very..... very.
PersonDirectedAbuse	it's not complicated. i'm assuming you grew up in a social environment that idolizes white people and it stuck with you. your media, your social circle, family idolizes whiteness so it's all you knew.      if you truly are interested in breaking away from this kind of thinking, i would stop with these moping posts. they make you look desperate and pathetic, no disrespect. i would also seek counseling, ideally a nonwhite counselor, and surround yourself with people of color. so get out of lakeview, delete grindr and download jack'd, make the best of it.
PersonDirectedAbuse	i agree with you, but it's also super obvious to me that the modern republican party doesn't follow jesus's teachings at all. i'm not saying jesus isa socialist or anything of that nature. but the president should be an example to follow and instead i see someone with nothing but hatred to the core. he promotes violence and division. i don't think i've ever seen him show empathy, the closest he comes is reading something written by someone else off a teleprompter.

Neutral	in a particular subreddit, they name and label innocent individual furries as zoophiles, which is a form of libel. no furries are allowed to post in there, so it's an echo chamber = no corrections = misinformation spreads like wildfire. and it makes its way to other subreddits, which is why so many people think that furries are zoophiles.

Neutral	again, try removing your ideological blinkers and listen to reason. there are no 'planks' in the manifesto: these are explicitly described (on a mere half page) as some of the historically and geographically varying strategies by which the proletariat can wrest control of the means of production from the ruling class. they are a means to an end. if you think the us is  socialist then you also think that 'end' has come about i.e. society is democratically managed by producers and class society abolished. my guess is that you don't believe that and, as is typical for today's libertarian anarcho-capitalists, 'socialism' is just used as a rhetorical device or as part of a cultish identity.
Neutral	i saw someone ask a girl theyve never seen out in a reddit comment section. wont say where or who, but man, that was rough lol. and it wasnt a joke, he straight up did it.       have some self respect yall. you've never even seen the people you're talking to here. you dont know if they're even who they say they are, and if they are who they say they are, what they look like or how they act is still a total mystery to you. you also dont know where they live lol good luck on dating someone who lives on a different continent.       didnt even see what the outcome was, but it's pretty safe to guess. but yeah, dont ask people out on reddit lmao

Neutral	i feel like i'd give up my soul not to work. well it feels like i'm giving up my soul when i am in work.       when you have mental health problems it's like doing everything on hard mode. i get quite anxious when i'm not performing well. and i have some social anxiety which means i can't defend myself or make friends easily or have any chance of promotion.       recently i've only managed to last a few weeks in roles before quitting. the work dread just becomes too much. i do always think to myself i can find a job i can deal with but i cant. even the low down jobs are very demanding and i can't keep up with the pace. i am on the verge of losing my current job as i keep getting told off and they are complaining i take too long to complete work which is costing them money.       i'm not saying i'm never working again but it feels like i haven't got the mental capacity to hold any job down. i don't know what i can do with myself.      edit: i also have a gf who has a professional job and i risk losing her if i don't work. i also risk being homeless and a lot of other things. probably not worth quitting but also i'm not sure how much i can take

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	doesn't matter if it's a joke, looking at several of the mods history on bpt they are extremely racist and this is exactly how they'd prefer the sub to be.      the comments on some of those posts fucking disgust me. and to make it worse they are getting tons of upvotes.      the sub should be quarantined/banned for blatant racism, toxicity and segregation and that's the end of it. same reason [USER] is gone.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	it's an effective propaganda tool for the right. find some edgy teenager's post on tumblr or some banal pop feminism, combine the two and you have instant propaganda. or in some cases, some angry tweet a girl writes after a bad breakup. literally anything they can find to use as propaganda, they will.

Neutral	i clicked on it thinking it'd be satirical, or critical of [USER], but no.      it's a crowd of readers who take the rhetorical question, "who says [group/person] can't [action]?" way too seriously. i can't even begin to comprehend how this started trending, but given the content there it seems like one of those "let me be angry about something" subs.      that is all.

Neutral	that's not what it means. gay - or rather, sexuality, is not the same as gender or sex.      **sex**: phenotypical morphological characteristics typical for the female or male reproductive organ systems.       **gender**: neurological construct linking sex to behavior. cisgender: neurological construct normally associated with behavior of same sex as gender. transgender: gender corresponding to one's opposite sex.       **sexuality**: relation between one's sex and attraction towards another sex.       i never mentioned sexuality in my claim about evolution, let me do that now. evolution has in fact paved the way for sexualities other than heterosexuality, which is not only evident in humans but also many other species across various phylogenies (therefore being a very old evolutionary concept).

Neutral	z-cash is controlled opposition; please look at this tweet from the lead developer here: [URL]      who decides what is a crime or not? traceable for some but not others? absurd! this alone indicates that their system is simply not private even when opting-in (which is a terrible model to begin with, as it only brings further scrutiny to private tx's. privacy should be default.)       furthermore, please look into the "trusted setup" of z-cash: you basically have to trust that the developers destroyed inception keys, which if not destroyed, give them the collective ability to print z-cash unchecked. there is no way to audit the total supply of z-cash to see if this is happening, too.       invest at your own risk.

Neutral	okay, that subreddit is not what i expected it to be about.
Neutral	for anyone too lazy to read the article, it talks about how a picture that was posted of her being excited seemed to imply that she was the primary person behind it.  she wasn't, and the people involved with the project never said that she was, but some on the internet got salty about it and started harassing her.      also gonna add that it's not accurate to measure someone's contribution purely based on the number of lines of code they wrote.  some lines of code are more important or more complex than others, other times many lines of code can be nearly the same thing written over and over again.  someone who checks over the code to fix any errors to be sure it compiles or just clean it up to make it easier to read for when other people will work with the code in the future may have zero lines of codes attributed directly to them, but is still an important part of the project.  seriously, learn to code, i have little experience coding and i'm not very good at it and even i understand this stuff.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	because they banned some of the best subs without warning and then censor content related to anything they don't like or don't agree with.  mods are terrible.      reddit sucks so much compared to 5 years ago.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	fuck you.      aboriginal people suffered, yes, because they were poor. same as the convicts. this is not about race, this is about economic exploitation and class dynamics.      >convicts are hardly victims of racial oppression though, because they were sent here by other white people.      no fucking shit, sherlock. maybe that's why i didn't say they were oppressed because of race.      but there you go, just like an sjw, "look at how your white neighbour has a little more than you, how your black neighbour is on the dole, look at differential crime rates, look at the drunken abos, look at the dole bludgers... just don't, for the love of god, look at the guys who own the tv companies and the newspapers. don't look at the well-fed and well-paid academics spouting this bullshit. don't question why your job was sent abroad for tax reasons. don't ask why your pay rises haven't kept up with inflation."

Neutral	because banning all white people from getting arrested isn't racist at all.      just why do they even need to keep bringing race into everything?
Neutral	if i may, i don't think many people understood how many reports that subreddit generated for the mods.  people clicked that report button like a gerbil on crack.  i had some issues to deal with (legit, actual, natural disaster related shit) and i told the other mods i needed a few days off.  so, i missed the build up.  but, i came back to find a mod queue with almost 100 reports needing attention.  i went through about forty of them and noted they were all leg humping related and user-on-user drama...so, i quickly typed up that post telling people how they could be their own superhero and mute people that pissed them off.     in my opinion and experience, we were pretty hands off and used to only get involved if the report was blatantly in violation of the rules.  because, frankly, the rules were pretty subjective.  personally, i only ever removed six comments in my tenure as mod.  most of the time, i just wrote a quick note to the person who was reported and the reporter to say "hey, guys...as a reminder, please...fill in the blank".  that worked for months!  then,  there was this sort of gang mentality that arose and the reports got petty and no one wanted to discuss anything. they just wanted to name and shame and started attacking each other. it was stupid. but, as i said, good luck to anyone modding that forum and i wish them well because it's quite a task.

Neutral	you're still on the site giving him clicks, dude lmao
Neutral	as a non-furry      i also think it's weird because i feel like... furry stuff is pseudo-mainstream, so i don't really get why redditors act all scandalized like it's some crazy, outrageous deepweb fetish. like... "anthropomorphic animals" have been a major part of popular culture for basically the entire history of popular culture, going back to the mass produced childrens books of the 1800s, into cartoons and comics of the 20th century, and now video games. it's not *that* strange that people would develop an affinity (no pun intended) for them when you grow up being bombarded with cheetara and lola bunny your whole childhood. most furries are like 90% human, 10% other.       like yo, sonic fans aren't into rouge the bat for her ears and wings, they're attracted to her "based-on-a-cartoon-human" hourglass body.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	recently, some scandals involving seungri (member of big bang) and his club the burning sun exposed a lot of stuff.       he was providing prostitutes for potential investors (this is a bit political theater because everyone knows korea is rampant with prostitution even though its illegal and the government doesn't do anything about it)      but also the security at his club was apparently helping vips drug girls and bring them back to the vip rooms for sex/rape.      in addition to this, private messages from a chat group got leaked that involved multiple high profile people in the music industry chatting and talking about actually going out and raping girls (directly using the korean word for rape) and one was sharing secret videos of his sexcapades (which is a whole other issue in korea since they ban real porn sites so people share illegally filmed spy camera porn and such) including prefacing some of them saying that he was only filming because she was passed out because he knew she would say no. one of the girls involved is in twice.      so with this, everything associated with seungri and the others is fairly barren. his label owns some restaurants that feature some yg branding and they are totally empty, and the ramen shops franchised under his aori ramen brand are also virtually empty all the time.      shits wild. like, when you see crazy western feminists call america a rape culture, on so many of those points, korea legitimately is a rape culture in so many ways.
Neutral	i'll disagree with you there.  i've been in the back as a patient and a professional and sometimes it's definitely worth that much.  the sheer volume of drugs and equipment used in emergencies along with sometimes 4 guys in the back working on you has to be paid for.      if people are willing to pay more taxes that's fine.  where i am plenty of cities charge residents $0 for rides.  other cities people vote down those tax hikes so them paying for all that equipment is in no way wrong.

IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	serious answer: because you don't get rich by doing sane-person things.       musk made a crazy investment in his brother's online ad company (where the board wisely kept him out of power) and lucked out by selling to compaq in 1999 just before everything tanked. then he rolled those profits into another crazy investment in x.com/paypal (where the board wisely removed him as ceo) and lucked out by selling to ebay just before amazon made them irrelevant. now his crazy is fully validated, there's an army of nerds who think he's a genius for sniffing his own farts for two decades, and he has too much money for anyone to check him.

Neutral	i ordered too much food for myself and decided against eating it all by my fat self by giving it to an old man. it was at an area in the central business district where i'd seen a few homeless men that have been sleeping at this bridge on previous occasions.             i struggled for really long before giving it, i imagined people looking at me weirdly and myself feeling awkward and shy about doing it for the first time over what would happen. (too much happy/emotional facebook vids of people doing good deeds)             it took me a good hour to actually to do it, and when i did he seemed abit confused as he was trying to sleep but kept tossing and turning. i just mumbled 'here's something for you to eat.'             nothing much happened but i stayed behind for a while and saw him opening up the packet of food, not sure if he ate it or not.             i don't feel especially happy or good, just really normal. it's my first time doing it and not something i'd normally do, but i sincerely hope it can help him get through for the few hours and make his night.

Neutral	>and therefore presumably worse situation **for** the insensitive one      everyone perceives the world and life subjectively, that's just how it is, that's how we have to get through life. it can be a good thing and a bad thing, and for people who are sensitive, for one, things might feel bad quicker than for others. but that doesn't mean that the pain they're suffering is less "bad" for them - as you said. because that's how they perceive and feel it, so that's absolute reality for them, even if objectively the issue isn't as bad. they still have to live through it. they have to go through the exact pain someone less sensitive would have to go through because of an objectively worse issue. (most?) people experience life subjectively. the limit to feeling a certain amount of pain for someone sensitive might be lower than for someone less sensitive. but it doesn't mean it's less real, it doesn't mean they're in need of less support and understanding and empathy. it's the same, felt, pain. often, a sensitive person will feel happiness quicker and easier too. does that mean they are, really, less happy than a less sensitive person?       but this was just a rant and i'm sorry if i misunderstood your comment.

Neutral	this has been bugging me for such a long time. every time i see these posts i'm filled with sadness of the good old days, and anger of the fact those days are gone.      my grandparents owned a large chunk of and island with 4 cabins in georgian bay. this was their cottage, and their children and grandchildren were able to go up any time they wanted in the summer. and we did. my grandparents loved having everyone up, and everyone loved being up there. the big dock, the kayaks, the boat the grandkids could use whenever they wanted, the cool water, the beautiful sunsets, this place was heaven. when it was my grandparents cottage, their 3 kids were equal in how many times you could go up, the rules were the same, and everyone was welcome whenever they wanted.       everything changed when my grandparents passed away.      my grandfather had cancer which took over his body quickly. so while he was still alive he put the cottage on sale, and we all went up one more time. it was nice closure. we all said our goodbyes to this place that held so many memories in our hearts. and then my aunt and uncle decided to buy it. they promised everyone nothing would change, we could all go up whenever we wanted, etc. but that wasn't realistic. their kids, my cousins, have first dibs when it comes to going up. if their kids bring friends, there's no room for the other 2 families. if my aunt and uncle bring their friends, same thing applies. i don't have an issue with this, because it's their cottage. what i have an issue with is the constant stream of instagram stories and posts every weekend of them renovating cabins, photos of the sunsets, or photos of them relaxing on the dock. recently they posted a photo of them driving around in a boat that was so sentimental to my grandfather he never let any drive it. and there they were in bikinis and drinks sitting on the back driving it around. seeing all of this makes me upset. they have every right to enjoy their own cottage, but it's just insensitive of them to constantly post about their great weekends up there when the other 2 families who used to enjoy the same things only get to see it through a smartphone.      i just wish they would be able to enjoy their new cottage without having to show all of us how much fun they're having. without showing us how each cabin is now one child's mini house. how a cottage which could hold over 20 people can now only fit 8. i want to forget about this place, but i can't. i'm constantly being reminded of my grandparents and feeling huge waves of nostalgia.

Neutral	their point is that they don't believe that it is all about the performance of the individual.  they are hyper-egalitarians.  they don't just favor the principle of equal treatment, they believe that all people are born the same.  as in they believe "all men are created equal" to not just be a principle to apply in certain legal situation, but a description of reality.  as each person starts as a blank slate, any disparity can only be a result of an evil social construction like discrimination or stereotype.          a rational person might see the impact of testosterone or estrogen.  they could use evolutionary psychology to guess why the sexes would diverge in behavior.  they could keep an open mind to what the data says rather than dogmatically stick to the same explanations regardless.  they would observe that nurses are 90% women across a broad spectrum of countries and be open to the idea that an instinct associated with motherhood lends itself to nursing rather than assume it is pure social conditioning.

Neutral	superhero movies is such a broad and populous genre at this point as to make statements like that meaningless.       ghost rider 2, black panther, mystery men, logan, into the spider-verse, v for vendetta, fant4stic, the dark knight, suicide squad and shazam are all 'superhero movies' despite most of them being more disparate from a story and filmmaking perspective than any number of westerns or elizabethean dramas or noirs. making any statement about the *entire genre*  of 'superhero movies' is senseless, yet i see it all the time. i doubt the next generation will lump them all together so cynically.

Neutral	lol - this idea that we owe someone for a previous, present or even future wrong doing is a ridiculous game. my family wasn't even in the united states during the civil war yet we'd owe reparations.       if one man has a dollar he didn't work for, some other man worked for a dollar he didn't get.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	this is, again, missing the main reason why there are almost no real poc artists: they can't get over their race.      there are basically no white classics about being white. it's all about having dreams (gatsby), insanity/politics (cuckoo's nest), broader pictures of morality (mockingbird, scarlett letter, etc), and much more.      if you can't get over your "identity," you can't write truly transcendent works. if you can't do that, you'll never measure up to the classics

Neutral	here's my view:      in one way, you're correct: there is no death, because you're not your body. the essence of you, what is sometimes called the mind-stream, abides.      we have the taxonomy upside down: the basis of all that is experienced is mind, which, much like space, is ephemeral and cannot be easily pointed to, yet it is the very expanse in which phenomena occur.      we tend to accept the notion of the primacy of matter, but that's an a priori assumption and contradicts empiricism (long, long debate). consciousness does not arise from matter; perceived matter arises from consciousness.      we find this appreciation in many spiritual traditions: the kingdom of god is within you, you have buddha-nature, all is the tao yet the tao is nothing etc.      quantum physicicst max planck said it in another way:      "all matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force... we must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. this mind is the matrix of all matter."      as for our bodies and everything else in this world, it doesn't matter what you believe. it actually seems a lot of people don't really accept they will die, at least not in a very visceral way, and not in a way that very often makes us behave accordingly.      there isn't even a single black swan here. do animals know they will die? if not, why do they die if your theory is correct?      a body (and ego for that matter) is a phenomenon based on causes and conditions which exhaust themselves. it is by definition a transient and compound phenomena. such is the nature of dualistic experience.      the path to immortality is pretty much the opposite of not believing in death as a human. rather, it is to realize the potential we have in this form to transcend our basic ignorance of dualism and radical philosophical materialism.      you might also enjoy donald hoffman's take on the issue of nature of consciousness and reality, though he doesn't go quite as far as i do here.      [[URL]]([URL])      the biggest conspiracy ever, i believe, is the one we perpetrate against ourselves in every moment where we identify with anything other that the pure, lucid expanse of experience, which is not only our ultimate and absolute nature, but also the only thing we can know without a doubt exists.      at this point, for the vast majority of us, our consciousness and experience misapprehends itself and splits all phenomena into a subject-object duality, which is a prequisite for the experience of causality, the functioning of which is what we perceive as time.

"socialists" think the government should work for the people, not billionaires that have managed to capture politicians.       there are things the government does better than the private sector.  education, healthcare, anti-poverty operations, infrastructure, etc etc.      what they support is a capitalist economy with strong social safety nets. and overall, their system is superior to the one you want, on every level possible.      provably so.

Neutral	i mean, the duggars are part of a religion/cult wherein the women are barely more than breeding stock, the men are given total control (aka "headship") over their families, and there are quite a few convicted/accused (with proof) sex offenders in high places. members of the cult are vehemently anti-lgbtq rights and anti-women's rights, among their other nasty beliefs. plus, the duggar's oldest son molested his own sisters when the girls were small children. the girls were encouraged to forgive him because jesus (and then had to publicly forgive him on a talk show...) and the brother was never formally charged. rather, they just shaved his head and sent him to a construction project for a few months while they hysteria died down. so yeah, i get that without context it seems like a ridiculous thing to snark about the duggar's. but this family has a national platform from which they can spew their awful shit and they victim-blame their own children... i don't think they deserve a pass.
Neutral	disagreed. plenty of people are too nice and too insecure, or have lost their overview on a situation, or are seeking another perspective on a genuinely difficult situation.

Neutral	stop wishing for true love, don't look at your dates harshly and cut those that don't fit the 'he's gonna be my husband' feeling.         it is hard to find a man that really seems to want a serious relationship which guarantees marriage, you must know yourself how much harder it is when half the boys don't even give you a chance.          you said that life is fleeting, enjoy every opportunity instead of chasing a prince on a horse, because whatever you might believe of yourself, you can make no good judgement on which unlikely relationship will turn into *that one*. nobody likes incertainty, nobody likes to talk of serious shit when they don't even know the person well, even less so if they don't know the person well and the person is also someone in your case. give every improbable relationship a chance of knowing you and put no pressure on it. no obe wants to hear the stranger they've been dated for 3 weeks is dead-serious about long-term commitment and has more string attached than a corset.            and in case you might start with 'you don't understand'... well, you might not actually understand it either. it is easy to be isolated, refused, frail, and to think you have had all the time in the world to know how things work. it is easy to let the hatred or spite that grows from the feeling of injustice get the better of you. it is also easy to let yourself down. the world is not as naked when you don't have the full picture, even less when you think you had it because of overthinking and over-analysing stuff.          good things will come for you once you let yourself open. but to let yourself open you need not to let yourself down, not to think you understand the world, relationships and partners as well as you might do, and especially, you need to take the risk of losing time and offering yourself a chance with people that might not appear as commited as you wish, even if it is not what you think you want.
Neutral	i ate at a mexican restaurant a few times does that make me racist
IdentityDirectedAbuse	     true! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am; but why will you say that i am mad? the other laowai had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. above all was the sense of hearing acute. i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. i heard many things in hell. how, then, am i mad? hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly i can tell you the whole story.      it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. object there was none. passion there was none. i simply loathed the other aowai. he had never wronged me. he had never given me insult. for his gold i had no desire. it was none of these, no qualm had i with him. it was the changes in everyone else!  i was no longer getting the stares i used to, my students don't say i'm handsome anymore, the jianbingguozi ayi no longer skip the chilli sauce for me and even the milf at the massage parlor don't give me discount for happy ending anymore.      now this is the point. you fancy me mad. madmen know nothing. but you should have seen me. you should have seen how wisely i proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation i went to work! i was never kinder to the laowai than during the whole week before i killed him. and every night, about midnight, i turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! and then, when i had made an opening sufficient for my head, i put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then i thrust in my head. oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in! i moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that i might not disturb the other laowai's sleep. it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed. ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, and then, when my head was well in the room, i undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously –i furiously dafeijied to the dick pics he had sent to rainy on his waysheen. and this i did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but i found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the other laowai who vexed me, but rather the attention he had diverted from me. and every morning, when the day broke, i went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. so you see he would have been a very profound laowai, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, i dafeijeed to all his indecent photographs he thought privately sent to rainy.      upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door. a watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. to think that there i was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. i fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. now you may think that i drew back --but no. his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the happy giraffe saved countless fortune by giving us apartments without windows,) and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and i kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.      i had my head in, and was about to open the flashlight on my coolpad, when my thumb slipped upon the meipai app, creating a very "meng" selfie, but also setting off the camera flash, and the other laowai sprang up in bed, crying out --"who's there?"      i kept quite still and said nothing. for a whole hour i did not move a muscle, and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down. he was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as i have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. feeling my shohwdeedee fill with blood in anticipation of the pictures he had sent to rainy tonight.      presently i heard a slight groan, and i knew it was the groan of readying his member for dick pics. it was not a groan of pain or of delight --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with the need to hear 'wa! so big!". i knew the sound well. many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. i say i knew it well. i knew what the other laowai felt, and envied him, although i chuckled at heart. i knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. his fears had been ever since growing upon him. he had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. he had been saying to himself --"it is not impotence, it is merely the 4 yuan baijiu i had for dinner," or "i am just nervous about aids since i fingered a prostitute." yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. all in vain; because death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room.      when i had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, i resolved to open a little –covered the coolpad flashlight with my finger. so i opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the other laowai's pale litter bit fat belly.      it was open --wide, wide open --and i grew furious as i gazed upon it. i saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull grayish white, freckled with what must have been acne, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but i could see nothing else of the old other laowai's face or person: for i had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.

Neutral	i dont think it's ever been acceptable in modern history for men to be expressive about their emotions. regardless, we live in 2019, not in 1000ad. i mean the whole idea of toxic masculinity is that men aren't allowed to express emotion. women can express their emotions publicly and find comfort even from strangers, this is not a thing that men get.       > men's bodies and feelings were valued a lot more than women's bodies and feelings.      men's bodies ? what do you mean ?       > it's only been a very, very short window of time when women were even considered to be equal to men      i mean, yes in the grand scale of human history, (though who knows when misogyny started) but i mean for as long as i've been alive women have been seen as equal.

Neutral	     > i have so many questions...      > this washington post-abc news poll was conducted by telephone august 16-20, 2017 among a random national sample of 1,014 adults, including users of both conventional and cellular phones. the results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. sampling, data collection and tabulation by ssrs of glen mills, pa.      this is what i had read initially and had thought all 1014 answered each question, i hadn't seen the specific vote counts. that's my mistake, though i don't think an n of that size necessarily renders a poll worthless, and i still stand by my view that "nobody supports them except those in the group" is an exaggeration, and a potentially dangerous one at that.       i also want to point out that the concern isn't so much the people that some people may currently support neonazism or white supremacy, it's those who aren't necessarily in that world but are susceptible to brainwashing and propaganda. before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. not the case anymore. it's the same mo that isis uses — find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that — it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). you don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. you don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. as long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. but that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. it's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. and you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by.      ^just to be clear, this is in a generic "you", i'm not accusing you of any of this      > hit in the head with a baton or bat      i hope it's clear that i don't condone this whatsoever. and this isn't okay regardless of the victims political affiliation.      > majority of people agree it's bad, which is not the case with the things antifa does.      but in order for this to be at all relevant — you would have to believe that antifa is exactly as bad as all the white supremacists and neonazis that i linked. again, can you point to any political assassinations or murders by antifa? or any things that are directly parallel to *any* of the stories i linked?      i'm also *very* doubtful that most people don't disagree with antifa in general, let alone specifically the violent actions.      > the difference between supporting assholes.      do you think all assholes are created equal or something? would a guy who gets road rage and brake checks you be as much of an asshole as a guy who leaves his 2 year old child in the car while he gets smashed at the club, crashes head on and kills 5 people including his child?            people don't have to think about these things in a completely black and white way. you can agree with a particular groups intentions and motivations without condoning all of their actions. just because two groups do bad things does not by nature of that make them equally immoral.         the hoax stuff is interesting and probably worth exploring but not sure how it relates to this stuff.

Neutral	during the gfc the big four central banks - the federal reserve, the ecb (europe), boj (japan) and pboc (china) began the process of quantitative easing which is ultimately just printing money but instead of just printing money and giving it out to everyone to spend they directed all the money into the banking system which was then used to loan out at extremely cheap prices for people to buy assets. this is why we have an "everything bubble" right now. and why real estate values in many cities have gone extremely high.       last year the big four central banks stopped this money printing process and started raising interest rates which caused global asset markets to start crashing as the banks no longer had endless money to lend out they had to "tighten lending standards". in canada they said it was the new "mortgage stress test laws", in the uk they said it was "brexit uncertainty", in australia they said it was "the royal commission into the banks", and in the us they said it was a mix of fed rate hikes and us-china trade talks. all these events across the globe conveniently had the same impact at the same time in their respective countries which just so happened to occur when the central banks ended quantitative easing (money printing).       it looked like everything was crashing up until december 2018 however come january global asset markets suddenly revived. that's because the chinese central bank (pboc) started printing billions of dollars again: [URL]      however the central banks have a problem and that is the modern monetary theory movement:     [URL]      the lower classes have woken up to all this endless money being printed to prop up the assets of the elite and now want a piece of the pie. they are saying "if you can print endless money to inflate stock markets and real estate you can print endless money to pay for healthcare and infrastructure". the central banking cartel cannot have this for obvious reasons. it is at that moment where the global financial markets will crash and ww3 will begin in order to create a distraction as to the instability caused by the central banking system.       we are not at that point just yet as the central banks are still able to perform qe without question from the msm but when it becomes obvious to the masses that this is simply printing money to prop up asset markets and should be used for social services and middle class citizens struggling with mortgage repayments this is when the msm will draw attention to how unsustainable qe is and it will all end in a devastating debt driven crash.

Neutral	the problem is that bicycles are considered vehicles the same way that cars are for some reason. if you hit a car at a stop light it's not a crime and the only repercussions will be points on the lisence of the at fault driver, do the same thing with a cyclist and the law views it the same way, even though the risk of serious injury and death is much higher.      the case you mentioned became a crime because the driver left the scene of and made it a hit and run. there are even rarer cases like what happened in kalamazoo michigan a few years ago where a driver went out of their way to hit a group of cyclists and was charged with multiple counts of murder.

Neutral	went down the rabbit hole on this one.      this article is from palm beach, 7/17/2008      [URL]      >donald trump closed the deal tuesday on his record sale of 515 n. county road, the former abe gosman estate, to russian fertilizer mogul dmitry rybolovlev.    the sale of the 6-acre estate was announced in may      >although trump calls it a $100 million deal, the deed lists the sale price as $95 million. trump, in a call from his office in new york, said the higher figure includes closing costs. the documentary stamps for the deed came to $665,000.      >the real estate developer and reality tv star said reports that he spent $25 million to renovate the mansion are false. construction permits issued since he bought the property in 2004 have a listed value of $502,470, according to jackie kervey, records manager for the town of palm beach.    "i always looked at it as a teardown," trump said.      okay, so the next article:      [URL]      this is from april 2016 and says the property was now going to be demolished, i guess it went unused for eight years? idk, it's kinda vague.       there's a weird quote in here from trump:      >in the same interview, trump said he wasn't sure whether his russian buyer planned to actually live in the house. "i'd imagine it'd be for a home but i don't know, other than i know he made a great deal. i think time will prove that out," trump said.   and had the deal not gone through? trump had a backup plan: "i'd be very serious about building a world-class hotel (on the property)," he said a couple of months before the transaction closed. "i know our palm beach fathers are thrilled about that."      uhhh... wut         by the way, both of those articles are scrubbed from the internet, except for the archives.      so the owners of this property from earliest to latest were:      -jayne and charles wrightsman, socialites and art collectors (1947-1985)      -leslie wexner, retail mogul and jeffrey epstein's only known financier (1985-1988)      -abe gosman, healthcare mogul (1988-2004)      -donald trump (2004-2008)      -dmitry rybolovlev, fertilizer mogul (2008-present?)      idk. there's at least some connection here. i could use some help digging.

Neutral	great, so you get to live longer and be brought into an environment of destitute and poverty as a cuban. and this idea that the cuban government cares for its citizens is ridiculous. the government doesn't give a shit. the incredibly dedicated and selfless cuban doctors, cuban citizens themselves, are the ones that are caring for their fellow citizens.      so, how does the cuban government treat its doctors? well, since all these cuban doctors are basically government property, they're exported out to make money for the government. what's the cut that these doctors receive from their respective host countries?      [URL]      > according to a report by prisoners defenders, a spain-based ngo that campaigns for human rights in cuba and is linked to the patriotic union of cuba (unpacu) opposition group, **doctors on average receive between 10% and 25% of the salary paid by the host countries,** with the rest being kept by cuba's authorities.      but in monetary terms, that's actually a pretty damn good prospect for these doctors, because:      > the wages on offer were another strong incentive for dayli, who is originally from the small cuban city of camagüey, to join up. going from a doctor's salary on the island of just $15 a month in 2011, she says she was paid $125 monthly for the first six months in venezuela, a figure that rose to $250 after six months and $325 during her third year. her family in cuba also received a bonus of $50 a month.      this pittance is considered a "strong incentive." you can sit on your ass in front of a computer doing "beer money work" and make several times more than what these doctors make.      of course, the cuban government doesn't really care too much where these doctors are sent:      > but according to a new report, some of the doctors themselves say conditions can be nightmarish - controlled by minders, subject to a curfew and posted to extremely dangerous places, james badcock reports.      you also don't get to bring your family with you as you're shipped out. and you have no say in any of this. it is almost like slavery.      so, is this what caring looks like?

Neutral	i bought an app called coldturkey (there's a free version) that blocks reddit (and other sites) during certain hours because it was getting a bit distracting.      i also comment on youtube videos, far less censorship there.      i have uses for reddit outside of what i mainly use it for (politics/culture), so i can't fully get rid of it, but i split my free time up because, like you, i know how garbage this site can get.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i think this will be extremely valuable in swaying people. as we fit into every one of these to varying degrees. (some of them 100%) one of the biggest problems it that the average american doesn't. know. what. the. fuck. fascism. is... and that's a massive problem. so i'd like to create a very clear, modern collection of examples people can use as a reference. i would really love it, if this lovely community contributed their own thoughts or examples!... (from me, a supposed "nazi," which is a term that has no meaning annymore. lol.)      ​      -powerful and oppressive tech companies: we have citizens that are blindly allegiant to tech companies that represents ideas that are completely failing thanks to the very ideals they worship. the definition of "safety" has become a dog-whistle of sorts, as well as the definition of "violence," the definition of the phrase "hate crimes," etc. have all come to mean "things i don't like," and have utterly racist and violent implications today. google's "do the right thing" implies that their employees know america is not doing the right things right now. but to openly question that would make them feel like a white supremacist/misogynist.      ​      -disdain for different opinions: this is why you can't try to appeal to radical left-wingers' humanity by saying: "but people will suffer if this happens!" they don't care. i have diseases that require me to get medical attention, and it has made me broke my whole adult life. nobody cares. there are people in concentration camps in this country. (how much clearer does it need to be?) there are massive crime rates and other issues that, of no fault of their own, affect so many vulnerable people in our society. and any time a potential solution, or even an empathetic observation is made: the country blows up. they don't even want to acknowledge men suffer too. even after you tell them it's degrading and offensive to focus on women on issues where men suffer the majority of the time. and it would take them no effort at all to acknowledge those men. they just hate men. which is why they want to change the definitions of words like hate speech and racism. in general, they're bullies who only respect science when it's to fallaciously appeal to nature and go on about "spectrums" and how they're essentially science-deniers in so many words.      ​      -identification of enemies as a unifying cause: lgbtq republicans, white people, black christians, middle-easterners, jewish people, etc. it's the same strategy every time: the tech corporations use these people as scapegoats via propaganda and history revisionism, fake data, etc. to convince you that "these degenerates and undesirables" are the reason your life is going to shit. they don't want people realizing they're the reason you're suffering. they also attempt to turn people against the current government, as they offer protections for these people. this helps these tech-corporations begin to replace the government.      ​      it makes it easier to brutalize and fuck over lower classes and minorities, and even just poor/broke men. since the 90s massive amounts of university professors and hate groups, all hellbent on dismantling the government, have been forming in financially well-off white areas, like upstate new york, where people have been affected drastically by their jobs being sold overseas. and angry, desperate people with shit education get indoctrinated easily into all of these arbitrary "social justice" or "dismantling" movements. they now all hate right-wing people, christians, white people, jews are all white supremacists to them, and they definitely hate the immigrants that disagree with their politics when not a single one of them even lives in most of their upper class secure neighborhoods... (lmao.)      ​      -supremacy of the media: uh, yeah. lmao. we have the largest, most expensive media in the history of the planet. we spend far more than everybody else, even if a ton of that money could be far better used elsewhere. we've been conditioned, steadily more and more since the nixon-era to believe this is necessary... and after 9/11, the news media realized that this was a perfect opportunity to expand their agenda to make even more money. this is when the country started to become particularly fascist, and the brainwashing really began. they conditioned us to blindly kiss the feet of every journalist, and to approve of every pointless, harmful cause they champion. they say it's "moral" to do that. this is the argument fascists use because they never have logic on their side. they just call you "immoral" and sic the dumb asses on you to harrass you.      ​      a logical person sees these media for what they are: stupid, braindead, and they're massively contributing to brain washing and widespread suffering across countless lives, including our own children. if you criticize any of this? well, they wouldn't want a repeat of gamergate. they started labelling people alt-right who had different opinions banned from social media for having daring to tell journalists to "learn to code", for instance. (alt-right is a dog-whistle by the way. you should know that.) and again, any time you criticize anything the media is involved in post-gamergate era, they can pull the: "this is harrassment! how dare you disrespect them!" card.      ​      -rampant sexism: yeah. men are under a ridiculous amount of attack. men are harassed more than i've ever seen these days. men in politics or in any position of power are degraded, thrown an insane amount of threats and venom, and they're mistreated. false rape accusations are a big joke to people, and not taken seriously. anita sarkeesian said "believe all women," to men who told her they've been falsely accused. and she started pushing their buttons until she started to cry and yelled: "help!  abuse!  harassment!" when they disagreed.  and this was seen as hilarious to her and her fans. it ended up in: jezebel articles everywhere.      ​      and feminists feel so entitled to men's bodies and their lives mean so little that it's both disgusting and terrifying. (hillary clinton once said: "women have always been the primary victims of war." comes to mind.)

Neutral	i moved from the country to a suburb near sanfran as a kid just getting into highschool.       my birthday is in june, and there's a specific segment of my friend group who outright ignores my birthday in favor of the pride parades.       i have a very special distaste for pride due to that.          what i learned: you don't have to put up with shit, if the people that claim to support you, don't actually...       those people don't care about you like they should, and you don't have to be in their realm more than you have to.
Neutral	> it's sad that instead of discussing specifics and trying to figure out why single-payer would bankrupt hospitals or how they could change their plan to avoid that      that's the thing. i am relatively moderate and would be happy to have universal healthcare if they could do it well. but there are a lot of reforms that other countries with uh that they haven't addressed. some of them sound like reasonable tradeoffs, like tort reform (in europe they have a loser pays model and caps on special damages to rein in costs of frivlous lawsuits against healthcare providers) and the medical education costs are much higher in the us. but none of this shit gets addressed. all the blame is placed on corporate greed, which is why they will never make headway because their ideas are not sustainable without the right cost controls and reforms.

Neutral	there have definitely been times where i felt like an asshole at the time but realized later that i definitely wasn't. like, when i asked a co-worker that i'd previously gotten along well with not to touch me unexpectedly. he was clearly upset by it and i was worried that i'd been harsh, but i felt better about my decision after a few weeks. i know that's only one side of the situation, and i don't have his to give, so maybe i'm still the asshole, but if someone else told me the story as it happened to me, i would have a tough time finding them the asshole.        sometimes we're conditioned to be overly polite to people to our own detriment, and it's helpful to have someone tell us that we aren't assholes for taking care of ourselves. that's not 99% of the  posts in that subreddit, though.
Neutral	thanks for the warning. we knew someone in the plane that hit the pentagon and since that is in direct contradiction with one of the major 9/11 conspiracies, those places can be a bit *this does not spark joy* for me.
Neutral	my condolences. the best advice i can give you is to exercise, eat healthy (try the keto/carnivore diet). this is critical, as you do not want to be dependent on the medical cartel and their toxic pharmaceuticals. avoid any chemical dependence or drug use. use herbal remedies or alternatives whenever possible. do not isolate yourself. take care of your appearance and never neglect your grooming even if suffering from fatigue or depression. be visible in your community and live your life (want to see a concert? go see the concert). believe nothing that is "said" to you from "them." be peaceful in nature, slow to anger and avoid conflict whenever possible. always carry self-protection. remember, you're not a victim and you're not a punk. most important, focus on self-improvement and your spirituality. find a church, mosque, temple, etc. to involve yourself with.       remember, the trick is to get you to be your own downfall (it's a game of plausible deniability). completely ignore any threats because if it's your time, it's your time. try your best not to show any visible signs of your inner turmoil. share little personal information to strangers or coworkers, etc., but always appear positive and be helpful and courteous. listening to a lecture, having a movie in the background, or music can definitely help drown out all the "static", especially when trying to rest or sleep.       it's all easier said than done. this is your personal cross to carry. don't obsess on the cause and focus on the cure (or minimization) this life is a huge test, but you can do it.✊      god bless

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	the group that you're choosing to identify yourself with is a prime breeding ground for violence and bigotry, whose 'involuntary' identifier literally places the blame on women for depriving them of something they deem essential. if incels actually cared about personal responsibility they wouldn't have gone with that name in the first place.       you might not think you treat women different in real life, but the internet *is* real life. case in point: im scared to go to yoga now, and guess whose fault that is? the people who you're going to bat for.

Neutral	for anyone interested in the romance of the 3 kingoms, i **highly** recommend the romance of the 3 kingdoms podcast. the guy who did it noticed that the english translations of the romance were pretty dry and long winding so he decided to tell the story himself. he adds tons of infos that aren't in the book (historical context, supplemental episodes on famous characters and lifestyles, etc) and he's really entertaining.       he also looks at the story through a historic lense and most of the time comments  on the more fantastical parts of the book.

Neutral	there's a quote from an earlier game that i really like that goes something like: "strong pokemon, weak pokemon, that's only our selfish perceptions. truly skilled trainers should fight with their favorites." and tbh i feel like that's what the pokémon games should be about, at least at a casual level. meta? never heard of her. i'm fighting the elite 4 with a team of all cat pokemon and you cannot stop me.
Slur	is your username a reference to that time al sharpton accidentally said "the nigga word" instead of "the n-word" on tv?  if so, you might be the only other person who remembers that shit.        it had to have been force of habit.  al sharpton looks like he says nigga all the time.  either way it's funny.

Neutral	nononono, it's fine when the trans characters are super flamboyant, obvious, stereotypical, and funny. when it's subtle and the character is "normal" (as in not a stereotype some trans people could find offensive) then it's too far! /s      plus with ivankov and the okama, it was generally correct to say he/him, but with kiku they're upset that it's not as simple.      plus quite a few people most butthurt are upset they were "tricked" into finding what they now believe is a man attractive.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	when i was younger, back before internet, i found an old masonic pamphlet in the reserved section of the library. meaning you cant check it out.       it was for some bullshit ceremony they were doing and it had all the attendees and their occupations listed.       judges, cops, lawyers, firemen, business owners, architects...      just being part of some homoerotic boys club doesnt make you of a like mind. there is in fighting and squabbling in a mason hall as there is anywhere else.       it gets freaky when you fully realize just how pervasive it all is.       every podunk town has a mason hall.

Neutral	i sure hope so, would be nice to be inherently talented at something.
Neutral	your good friend prophet muhammad that you always support thought the same thing... oh, wait! no, he didn't.      **sahih al-bukhari volume 9 book 88 hadith 219**: "when the prophet heard the news that the people of the persia had made the daughter of khosrau their queen (ruler), he said, "never will succeed such a nation as makes a woman their ruler."      [URL]
Neutral	you would probably either love, or hate, [USER]             yeah i think i can appreciate where you are coming from. thing is - and you state this in your comments - suicide is really bad, and its so bad that the priority for 'prevention' has to override concerns for 'pisses me off'. personally im good with messages that are not twee or outright condescending, but i do wonder whether these types of messages may have a place, given, i guess, everyone reacts to these things differently. if these messages save 1 person and mildly irritate 1000 people, they have done their job.              anyhoo sorry you are in a bad place. hope things pick up for you soon. in the mean time, great rant!

Neutral	after talking with a mod from r/politics it appears that your post was officially removed from being off-topic. with the way they have their submission rules structured you are not allowed to make posts that include individuals, groups, or protests without the same article also discussing the political aspect of the individuals, groups, and protests. after looking through the link there appears to be no actual discussion related to politics as it is explicitly related to an event that occurred between politically motivated individuals. maybe post a link over there that also discusses politics? with the way they have their rules structured it appears to prevent any form of political backlash that goes against the far left narrative. no posts about fake news. no posts about political violence. no posts about your opinion of the sub. it is all strictly and rigidly only talking about politics (fake news or not) which will definitely mostly include orange man bad, american rape culture, muh russia, and other events that were not properly vetted.             if you take a careful look at all their posts you will see that they will include far-left opinions **as well** as how it effects politics.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	this shooting won't change any federal laws in the usa that you are thinking of (assault weapons ban bill is not even being considered). you may have some cucked states like cali impose some more restrictions but other than that nothing will change and 99% of states legislatures will not take any action. if trump even mentions gun control he is toast in 2020. that is the only thing left he has that he hasn't completely let his supporters down on.      only time gun control is considered is parkland-esque emotional mass shootings with soft target children involved. if this had happened in a purple state like georgia or north carolina then you'd see a state legislature take up some gun control to calm people down. this shooter wasn't a total sperg though. rising immigration and racial tensions while the feds or state take away the right to defend yourself is a possible trigger for a large scale incident in the us

Neutral	for background, i (25m) have been with my current girlfriend (21f) for nearly 2 years, and we have been going pretty well in terms of everything major. we rarely argue, we share very similar mindsets and interests, but the smaller differences are starting to affect me.         i can say that she could be my future wife if she dropped a few habits, but i honestly don't see her doing so. she smokes cigarettes and does a lot of recreational drugs; cannabis, mdma, psychedelics, and has recently been interested in dmt. she has mild depression, diagnosed anxiety, and doesn't have any hobbies. because she doesn't have any hobbies, she is always smoking marijuana daily, and she is always looking for the next opportunity to do mdma(once every few months) and i feel like her life is revolving around recreational drugs, albeit this is not heavy usage, purely to pass time. she is obsessed with having children and more pets, but at times her depression leads to neglect her current pets. she is insistent on having children in the future, but i can easily see the drug habits and depression affecting the well-being of her child and any future pets she wants to adopt. she does not see her drug problem as an issue, and says that she has the will to quit of necessary, but i don't believe her because i have seen how low her depression can pull her down.         as for some background on myself, i'm a quiet introvert with a lot of hobbies, stable job with a mortgage, i occupy my time with various things, like home improvement, computer games and watching netflix. i also have a lot of creative art hobbies that i do from time to time. my view on recreational drugs is quite lax, i am aware that they do have inherent health risks and toxicity but this isn't the sub to discuss that. what i am willing to say is that i also enjoy recreational drugs from time to time, but i'd prefer it to be less frequent, and for it to not be the main focus of an activity.          since being with my girlfriend, my drug usage has increased, and often times we will resort to smoking weed just to pass time. there is also a heavy expectation on me to sort out activities and entertainment for any given weekday, and she will complain loudly if not occupied. this will often default back to smoking more cannabis, which i'm not the greatest fan of.          i have suggested many times for her to adopt a hobby, but she dismisses this and continues to occupy her time with drugs, when i try to push the matter, she will need to smoke cigarettes to alleviate her stress.         i honestly love my girlfriend, and i can see us staying together indefinitely if we stay on a similar path, but her insistence of a child conflicts with her cigarette and drug use. i would have no issues with her lifestyle if she didn't want a child; but as she is so clucky and unwilling to care for herself,  i feel that any child brought into this world will be in danger.         i really don't know how to approach the matter, and i have been thinking about this for the longest time. i can't see her using less drugs, changing her mind about having a child, or picking up hobbies to occupy her time, and this is a major hurdle in our relationship. i can see us being best friends, and her having a child with another person, but i would still worry about the welfare of the kid, and breaking up and remaining mutual friends is always an idealistic situation that rarely works out.         i just wanted this off my chest, i didn't come here for advice, but suggestions or comments about my/her lifestyle will be read. thanks for reading.

Neutral	i'd say it's a fair bit different than europe because those tyrants were more successful. warring states periods in china are seen as transitory periods between one dynasty and the next, not the norm. the norm is to be a united realm. it's like if the roman empire had been properly rebuilt after its fall. of course this is excluding areas that were traditionally outside of han control, such as the western territories that weren't added until the qing dynasty.

Neutral	i knew this was going to pop up in here!      this is a dicey topic.  over there someone pointed out that she should have gone to a more pet friendly place, but people are forgetting that prior to esa laws opening up, it was *impossible* to find pet friendly places.  *especially* for large animals.  i lived in an apartment complex in the 00's with a dog run that allowed large dogs, and worked there for a bit.  we were the *only* complex that allowed dogs in the area, through the major city we abutted.  and by the time i left, they had come up with the brilliant idea of instituting "pet rent," an increase of rent to cover pet fees on *top* of usurious non-refundable security fees.        esa certification allowed people to have a pet, a desperately needed pet who yes, have been proven to have deep psychological benefits to their people, without having to go through all of the difficulties.  especially poor people, who are usually unable to find other methods of coping and need them the most.      on the other side, not everyone can handle esa's.  i love dogs, i've had some amazing dogs.  but i was attacked as a child by a few dogs and it took a while for me to manage my fear and distrust.  i still have a deep and unreasonable hatred of cocker spaniels, can't help it.  my husband is allergic.  i am too, mildly though.  if the dog has been bathed in a week, i'm usually fine.      we were in a pizza restaurant eating and a couple came in with an afghan dog.  they allowed some children to play with and pet the dog, which was shedding noticeably as it was summer.  my husband started to have an allergic reaction.  the couple sat, he asked the pizza people to please have the dog put outside.  as he was doing this, some customers came in behind where my kid and i were sitting, saw the dog, made disgusted comments, and left.      husband stormed back and left; they chose to keep the dog in the restaurant despite his visible allergic reaction.  my husband, the man i call snow white incarnate, who held a battered dog on the side of the road we found until the police arrived to take her to the vet, just wanted to eat in peace and this was denied him.  so, we left.  the emotional presence of a dog for that couple was more important than the physical health of my husband.      i've utilized the esa privileges (for housing), as i do have qualifying conditions.  i've never taken my animals anywhere they wouldn't legally be allowed without it, however.  i still remember vividly what it felt like to have that dog turn and look at me and lunge.  i still see it every time i see a cocker spaniel.  i see my husband with certain dog breeds, even though he adored them, red eyed, runny nosed, choking.  i also remember how lucky i felt to find a place that allowed big dogs so i could get my girl, and the amazing life i had with her.        it seems to me we need to have much clearer rules.  we need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it *and* places that allow it.  the issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option.  (seriously, one couple force bred their pitts to sell the litter - inbred idiots - and kept the pups indoors so we wouldn't know and then absconded in the night.  we had to go down to the sub floor it was so bad). if you force it to be open to all, then you have no place for the people who *can't* be around animals and are unable to afford to pay for a house.  why are they worth less than people who need esa's?      edit: fix words

IdentityDirectedAbuse	the other interesting thing is that when you ask people to come up with an argument for why incest is immoral, it's usually *really* tough for people to come up with one that doesn't apply to other relationships in problematic ways.        like, the  first thing people turn to is usually the risk of birth defects (which is probably one of the reason that we have a built in level of aversion to incest), but does that really apply in an age when contraception is readily available and widely used?  if risk of birth defects in children makes incest wrong, does that mean it's wrong for people with dwarfism to have sex?      same thing goes for power dynamics and grooming.  these are problems independent of incest, and ones aren't inherent if you're talking about similarly aged cousins or siblings.      i myself haven't really been able to come up with a strong argument for it being inherently wrong.

Neutral	i think you're incorrect on basically all counts here.       >the only thing trump has had to deal with that others haven't is an incredibly hostile media ... and mueller      i'd point you to the inordinate and record number of federal injunctions imposed by activist judges as evidence that this isn't the case, but my point here isn't simply that life is hard for trump      >what do you think is going to happen? do you think the 1-3% of the actual american populace represented by r/politics and places on reddit like it are going to cause some kind of massive uprising or civil war?      no, i think the roughly half of americans that are more sympathetic to the ideology that r/politics professes are going to be continuously influenced by an incredibly vocal minority (something which is pretty evidently happening) and that it's going to manifest itself in the mainstream in things like popular democratic presidential candidates advocating for an unconstitutional wealth tax and increasing the irs's enforcement budget. if you don't think warren is popular enough to be worried about, then kamala harris hand waving away your private insurance should be equally concerning even if it doesn't appear obviously as totalitarian.       assume that republicans win in a landslide in 2020, do you think the marxist ideas that have surfaced and been pushed to the forefront disappear entirely? they certainly haven't thus far in history. does the increasingly partisan divide in our politics that can be demonstrated empirically cease to exist?       if the only thing you're worried about is an out and out civil war and not your individual liberty and property being legislated away from you then you need to reconnect to politics. i get that my original comment doesn't really allude to these concerns but they're all interconnected as i see it.
Neutral	i don't think we should be judging how an 1800 year old warlord/ruler was depicted in a 14th century novel and a game based on it. almost every account of people taking power in most empires is a tale of ruthlessness even if their portrayals make them seem like gods walking on earth.      heck, look at ashoka. he is regarded as a near-saintly figure in buddhism, a champion of non-violence ideology of peace, and one of the greatest ever emperors of india and the world in his time...      ...who was also known for being an *extremely* bloodthirsty maniac who went on a mad rampage of bloodbath while crushing a peasant rebellion as a prince, executed a third of his family to secure the throne, killed every brother he had except one (who shared the same mother), burned people alive for slightest offenses, and launched a war that caused so many civilian deaths that one of the most raging tyrants of the age nearly lost his mind, turned 180 degrees and became a hardcore pacifist, conquered others only by scaring them into submission with polite military displays instead of wars, and later converted to buddhism.      there might be slight exaggeration from texts, but it is in the same vein as "liu bei threw the baby on the ground and cried hard because he nearly lost a great general and loyal friend for his sake".

Neutral	s.s. new zealand prime minister dawns a head scarf and joins the community in muslim prayer. not non denominational prayer. not a recognition of silence or mourning. not a secular display. muslim prayer.. this virtue signaling has gone on long enough. do they know how offensive it is to us that they are larping as a religion they do not hold? do they understand how disrespectful that is?

Neutral	the mandate of heaven was interesting. unlike the divine right to rule of the kings of europe, it had an exit clause of sorts - if the emperor was unfit, then the gods would revoke the mandate (often seen in lots of natural disasters happening), and there was then not just a need but a moral obligation to overthrow him.
Neutral	some socialism is good, too much is bad.  we don't want a heavy welfare state - just programs that work better at a government level: i.e. firefighters, police, roads, and public education.  i would advocate that universal healthcare, paid via taxation, should be included in that as well - but there are valid arguments against it as well.      no one wants to pay more taxes for "muh socialism".  we want it because the current way we do it sucks ass.
Neutral	imagine thinking there are still good humans in 2019. please lol
Neutral	he cares if he does or doesn't have sex. i don't really give a shit when people talk about going to sporting events or drinking beer all the time because i don't like those things. but when people constantly talk about sex that they're having that i don't have but want to have that makes me mad, mostly at myself because i think "those people have something that i want but don't have. what am i doing wrong that i can't have it?"

Neutral	i think people dying is bad. i sure do hope people stop dying. maybe this tweet will stop someone from dying.      of course there are ways to raise awareness via social media, but not doing so doesn't mean you fucking hate the cause or something. we don't have infinite time and energy to support every cause we agree with in every way possible. i think it's an unrealistic expectation of activism. in my opinion as long as you make some effort in some form to support the issues you care about the most when you can, you're good.

Neutral	that's exactly the point. if he were doing the "beginner sports car" thing i could understand it, at least. beginner sports cars like the 86 and the muscle cars and what not are a viable option, but as someone who is *ahem* bigger, they're stupidly uncomfortable unless you're buying a muscle car. he could buy an urus and still get that lamborghini style but also comfortability, but who in their right mind wants a lamborghini tuareg?

Neutral	seriously? telling someone to shove it up their ass is "problematic" now?
Neutral	i mean, i don't really get *upset* about things on the internet lol, i don't think antisemitic memes are totally harmless but i promise i'm not as triggered as you think i am dude      also it's kinda gross that a serious discussion about terrorism, 6+ incidents of foiled or successful acts of neonazism/white supremacy including a political assassination prompts you to drop a "hahaha triggerd libturd" line. grow up man. some shit actually matters in the world.
Neutral	the whole "reeeeee" thing is also connected to autism ("autistic screeching") but a ton of people don't realize that (or some of them just don't care and will try to tell you it's a 4chan joke).

Neutral	real talk
Neutral	what are the actual genetic risks? from what i've read inbreeding really mostly a problem under certain circumstances. such as either long term inbreeding (hapsburgs represent) or when both parents carry some kind of recessive trait that would be harmful but could be tested for.      i don't think there's actually all that much risk for a single instance of inbreeding. two cousins having a baby isn't going to spontaneously result in lobster-claws.      but i could be wrong, i just did some quick googling again and didn't come up with anything that makes it seem like you are guaranteed to have a water-baby or something.

Neutral	it's pretty simple really, exclusivity isn't competition and in fact can be observed to hurt it. a lot of is who are very vocal against epic were also very much in favor of steam not being a monopoly before.
Neutral	do whatever you have to to get out from under their roof. it will do loads for your mental health. i'm really sorry your parents seem like such shitbags. the thing with depression is you don't even need to have a bad life to be depressed. but they are definitely making it worse. go live your best life away from them and don't let them bring you down anymore! they are so so wrong. you don't need that kind of bullshit in your life. stay strong and good luck!
IdentityDirectedAbuse	> interesting how men seem so much angrier about this one instance of a woman allegedly lying than they are at the other men in this world who are actual abusers.      toxic masculinity at its best.   
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	not making all of your property communal property for all women to take as they please without giving anything in return is toxic masculinity
Neutral	i wish so because i want their attention...100% attention. sorry if this offends your sensibilities. it offends mine too. just want to get this off my chest...      i fantasize them getting into a car accident and dying....leaving me to perhaps just me and my mentor. maybe just one of his kid.    losing all of his family members will be extremely devastating for him.
Neutral	>wouldn't it being text based possibly point to a female dominant demographic? erotica seems to primarily be consumed by females after all.      good point, though i'm not sure if the demographics of people exchanging letters is different than the one reading erotica. women can get laid irl more easily and reddit isn't a big place for female-oriented fetish shit so i just assumed it was men.

Neutral	i agree
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	it's mostly luck that there hasn't been a really high-profile case of antifa or some other leftist killing people, and it's not for lack of trying. any one of these street battles could have resulted in a death if they happened to hit someone in the right spot, and of course there was the congressional baseball shooting where it's a straight-up miracle that no one died.
Neutral	well, they're attempting to, at least.      it doesn't work.

Neutral	i agree with you. it's not like this shit is uncommon. 1/4 pregnancies end up miscarrying. it's hugely common, super emotionally devastating.       the joke is insanely old, tired, played out and unoriginal.      every year people bring up not making this joke (seems like for the past decade at least.) and every year there's some asshole who says "uhh what? it's just a joke. hurr durr snowflakes."      tired of it.

Neutral	that's crazy, because i just unsubbed from r/pewdiepiesubmissions because they revamped their rules after this shooting to include "no hate speech" and rules that you can't make hitler memes.       and the people there are accepting of these rules because "everyone has the right to not be offended because of their race/sex/religion".       funny, nobody has shown me a single country that affords that particular right to citizens.       the "right to be free from offense" is imaginary and unenforceable in a civilized society.       little do the 9 year olds know, no matter how much they concede to the speech censors, they will never actually appease them.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	do not be surprised if they sacrifice the lives of us sailors and marines. they only think of themselves and use us military personnel. what most us citizens don't understand is that the all for israel zionists truly are wicked and they know their entire charade is on the verge of collapsing, thus they may up the ante and orchestrate a false flag as called for by winep, thereby sacrificing us sailors and marines.      israel lobbyist patrick lawson of washington institute for near east policy (winep)- we need a false flag to start war with iran! the pieces are being put in place. israel is growing more and more desperate. this is what trump was selected for. us loses      [URL]

Neutral	there may be differences in social power and economic power between "people of color and whites" but that does not mean a black person discriminating against a white person solely because they're white isn't racist, it is. the quicker we as a human race realize that race is a completely made up aspect of society the quicker we can all exist in semi harmony (war and hardship will always happen but maybe we can get rid of racism).

Neutral	good on you for being so great with the restaurant dog!      the dog in the restaurant is interesting. to my knowledge esas have no federal protections in restaurants. it's mostly that they get to live in domiciles and travel. i'm guessing your state could have extra protections. your thinking is very considerate and i like that.      my last dog wasn't an esa but he was a trained therapy dog. i say "trained" but he was a 3 pound long-hair chihuahua who already loved cuddles so it was mostly i who was trained. he would visit hospitals and nursing homes and even after he's passed we've kept in touch with some of the nursing home folk.      i plan on doing the same for my little guy. he'll be 3 this fall and it might be the right time.      >it seems to me we need to have much clearer rules. we need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it and places that allow it. the issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option.       agreed.       >why are they worth less than people who need esa's?      agreed as well. everyone's health concerns deserve to be taken into account and i do not envy the people who have to figure those things out.       but like you said, clearer rules are needed. not only for people who can't be around animals, but in situations like universities that aren't even the best/healthiest places for people, is it really in the best interest of all (including the animals themselves) to have animals in such tight, possibly unhealthy environments?      what my college did was have animals from a local shelter come for visits every now and then and advertise them heavily. it's not quite the same as having a companion but it went a long way to reduce stress and anxiety.
Neutral	it was kind of centrist.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	andy ngo or that older guy could have been killed with the level of violence they've risen to.  when you beat someone in the head to the point they have to go to the hospital with a brain hemorrhage, you're dangerously close to killing someone.      and i love how they pretend these were just 'milkshakes', when they were laced with quick drying cement, a dangerous chemical when it comes in contact with skin.

"we welcome illegal aliens with open arms and refuse to cooperate with the federal government in holding alien criminals or assisting with deportation."  well...enjoy the 100k illegals that the federal government can no longer hold in custody being dropped on your doorstep.      for a "failed businessman," trump really knows how to deliver.  democrats say what they want, he gives it to them.

Neutral	exactly! and this is why federalism was invented: to solve only those problems which can't be solved locally. that charade which infested every federally organized country the last 50 years subsumes democratic structures and replaces them with bureaucracy/technocracy.

Neutral	havent looked up to confirm anything you said yet but that reminds me of how women tend to have more with the average iq vs men tend to have more extremes as well. so it sounds plausible.       im too sick n tired to look things up right now though lol
IdentityDirectedAbuse	gays are so brave. of course they deserve a whole month. just look at all the great things they've done for our country! /s ️ ⃠
Neutral	no you did, don't worry. yes, it's horribly disturbing and the reason why i avoid twitter. a person's reputation could be destroyed before the truth comes out. and it doesn't even have to be a celebrity. look at the maga hat kid. people were calling for him to be expelled from school and blacklisted for life all because he stood and awkwardly smiled at someone.
Neutral	>  i specifically shitpost about goings on on facebook and twitter      i doubt they much care about westerners shitposting to other westerners.
Neutral	it's a obscenely convoluted plot that spans over the course of decades. men like cao cao and liu bei didn't even survive to see the end of the war.       it's one of those stories you need a notebook or read up online, there's just so much shit to go through.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	acting like dead boomers is a bad thing
Neutral	reported to admins.  that sub is becoming a problem.  the mods are not enforcing reddit's rules.  i guess it should be banned like cringeanarchy (it won't).

Neutral	you said it yourself in the end of your comment, you are still looking to him for approval. that right there is what you need to try and stop from. what i'm going to say is a lot easier said than done, but it's a true fact. you must first love yourself and learn to be happy with yourself before someone else can truly see your value. when you look to them for reassurance, they can feel it. it pushes them away. the hard part is finding out what you love about yourself and what it is that you find fulfilling. but you have to or you'll be stuck in this constant feeling that you care more than others do. in which there's a truth to it, you are valuing them more than they value you. they in turn are valuing themselves more. so you need to value yourself more.
Neutral	what is this from again?
Neutral	time to get redpilled on voat /s
Neutral	their sub description tells you directly they cant defend themselves with logic and the term "fragile white male" is based on pseudo-sociology (which is arguably not even science).  they literally start off telling you its one of *those* ~~echo chambers~~  ~~circle jerks~~ subs.
Neutral	same. i miss r/enoughinternet
Neutral	climate change is a scientific issue. full stop. even the issue of whether or not humanity has a significant influence on it is apolitical in itself. unless they're discussing climate change *policy* or politicians' relevant platforms etc. it's a purely academic discussion. contentious and political are not synonymous.

Neutral	lol nah dude he's super buttmad
Neutral	>the way it works (as far as i know) is all the tipping compensation goes to the top mod who then decides how it's doled out. reddit doesn't automatically distribute it across the mods.      if true, i think spez is doing this only for our amusement. literally no other sane explanation.

Neutral	people who don't think there should be helmet laws or seatbelt laws should have to take a week-long class where nothing but first responders, emts, cops, emergency department doctors, etc.  get to tell story after story, with pictures if (legally) possible, to explain what accidents are actually like when you don't wear a helmet (or a seatbelt).      death is the less likely outcome of a motorcycle accident. injuries are way more common, and while that can include scrapes and road burn, it can also be pretty serious.      related: i always remember a bunch of motorcycle riders i knew who used to sneer at those who ride wearing jeans and a t-shirt (or less).  they called these under-dressed riders "squids" because "that's what they look like after they impact the road" while riding at a good speed.

Neutral	it got some pretty good reviews. finally a total war with a good campaign map again, however it seems the battles did not improve much.      i think total war's next big leap will only come when neural network ais become commercially viable for games. there already are some remarkable projects - openai in dota and google's deepmind ai in starcraft have shown great promise. they can defeat top teams without cheating, and while much of that seems to be due to mechanical advantages (perfect precision and coordination, even though the developers limited their actions per minute and reaction speed) they still behave awfully human in many situations and can be downright creative.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	yep, it's amazingly retarded.      this is why i quite enjoy firearms, these lazy fucks are the type to go out and steal while justifying it to themselves. at least if they try to do it from myself, they will no longer need anything.      man that sounds horrible typed out, but i guess even in capitalism, bullets help the commies help themselves.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i feel a sense of basic human duty to help any person who's been as thoroughly benighted and brainwashed by hyper-consumerist escapism as incels, trump fanatics, etc... i consider it a measure of my own privilege that my own combination of upbringing, education, and luck made me avoid those trappings.      that said, a person always has to pick their battles and, more importantly, make sure that they're not wasting their time on people who are lost causes. i'd argue that wrangling these sorts of issues on the internet is probably close to useless. these are people who need to be socialized in a way that doesn't make it super easy to dive back into the wild west anonymity that online life makes so so easy.

Slur	wow...i'm definitely gonna look that up after i write this. i'm a very strong empath, i feel people truly and completely and i can always tell a person's character by a photo alone. i always sense when something is wrong, and nobody is able to lie to me. when they do it's like..a gentle silent buzzing in my head, and a strange physical prod in my gut. i can tell those who put on happy faces but are truly suffering..and tell the difference between truly troubled teens and those who say things like "i'm so depressed...mum took my phone away. i'm so impressed i hate this family!".       that's how i got the mama nickname. i take on board troubled youths, show them the kindness they deserve and teach them that no matter what, love and friendship are the way forward. one 15 year old in my friend group has adhd, and he can get very aggressive. if we're all playing games and something doesn't go his way, he screams and shouts, tries crashing the server, calls everyone horrible names..and of course the groups all yelling at him..and i've always been the one to calm him. just by treating him like a damn human being. and because i have a true love for police and other emergency services, he now wants to be a good cop and put bad guys away. that makes me a very proud mama ♡    my boyfriend might have high sensitivity.  his intuition saved my life last month.    sorry for the eiffel tower of text lol. i guess when you meet another person who has this blessed but cursed gift, i feel i can talk to them without fear of being judged for being a big soft ball of emo fluff lol. my bf is quite feminine and moves very elegantly. he has marfan syndrome so he's quite lanky xd. he's one of those people where like...just being near him makes everything brighter. he lights up the room and takes pride in his appearance.  he's always getting bullied and yelled at..called a poof, a homo, gayboy etc. it doesn't phase him. he's comfortable being straight and a little bit girly. i just wish i didn't cry if someone so much as giggles at my appearance :(

Neutral	my understanding was that people were actually moderately excited to learn more about magne.      sadly magne ended up being only half the character she could have been.
Neutral	i would also be pissed if they changed someone black to someone white, or if a female character was changed to male. it's not a case of racism, it's a case of accuracy which gender swaps and race swaps basically get rid of.

Neutral	it can be really hard to hear this. but i think you should hear it... this is kind of abuse on her part.      i went through something similar, and if you're open to suggestions, however small, i would suggest this.      this "abuse" doesn't mean things can't be fixed. she most likely doesn't even realize she's doing it. one of the most important things in relationships is communication. that being said, it's important that you communicate to her how you're feeling about this. i would advise sitting down, no tv on or electronics in hand, no distractions. a real talk.      i don't know enough about you guys and your relationship to say more, but as a random internet stranger, i would strongly recommend communicating this to her. you live together and are starting great careers. it sounds like your relationship has great potential. it's good for you to be able to communicate through issues like this.      good luck friend, i sincerely hope you and your love can fix this.

Neutral	stop oppressing me with your tags.  just because the majority of people on the internet are too stupid to recognize sarcasm doesn't mean we have to enable their mediocrity.  the only tags i recognize are /b, /u, and /i.  also /thread.      if anyone read my original comment and didn't get the sarcasm, congratulations, you're also the joke and i'm laughing *at* you.  derisively.  contemptuously.
Neutral	i mean with facebook and twitter they're gonna have a hard fucking time stopping that shit.  they also don't seem to really care about it.  if you post it on wechat you're an idiot and you're practically asking for trouble.      honestly this shit is fairly standard for china, doing illegal shit and getting caught will see the company throw you under a bus in a heartbeat.  they are just covering their asses.  "oh but we told them not to do illegal work".  it seems to be getting worse with every year with more oversight of foreign workers by their companies and authorities.  everyone's ass is on the line.      i don't think it's really to do with the anniversary at all, in the last few years they've been ramping up policing against illegal activities and tax avoidance in china particularly against unregistered schools.  it's been all over the news.  it's probably more to do with that.  they wouldn't be issuing this if they weren't scared shitless or being pressured by the psb.

Neutral	it's worth looking into. it's unusual to actually *see* a bedbug at all because they feed when you sleep and are generally inactive otherwise. seeing one out of its element is an indication of crowding or territorial expansion.

Neutral	> conversely, i've seen almost no one argue against people who literally cannot buy a game legally pirating, much like how no one gives a shit if you download the original super mario bros. 3. but games like the outer worlds and possibly borderlands 3 aren't even out yet.      spend more time on reddit, especially places like r/nintendoswitch. there's people who absolutely will argue that piracy is never ever ok no matter how inaccessible something is. like, people who don't even think you should pirate satellaview stuff, because "you have no right to it!!"

Neutral	right, my opinion is the same regardless of sexuality, i don't want to see gays nor straights doing that shit in public. i get that i am rather conservative in a lot of ways and others aren't and that's fine. i just feel that bedroom shit should be saved for the bedroom and not for public consumption, regardless of orientation. but, as with all things, the loudest voices get the most attention, and thats the banner that gets wrapped around us all. we fought for years to remove the "gay men want to fuck little boys" and then here comes the pedo acceptance people. it's tiresome, and frankly i am just done with all of it. i was fine with civil unions which we could have had ages ago, but some just had to have the word marriage and now that's a whole thing. i didn't care about the word, i cared about being taxed the shit out of because as far as the law was concerned i was room mates with my hubby and we made a shit ton of money separately and uncle sam was way deep in our pockets.      sorry, kinda got into a ranty blog post, it's been a fucked up couple of months so yea lol

Neutral	i almost did it. i almost ended myself.      i'm in a better state of mind now, i'm safe.      but i felt unsafe. i felt lost. i did not want another breath.       a jumble of relevant info;      i am uninsured, stuck in a job i hate for the good money i make, stuck in a manipulative situation at home.      my boyfriend and i (24f) have plans to move away from everything, but even that adds to the stress that sits like an elephant on my chest.   i'm depressed, clinically, and my anxiety runs rampant sometimes.    on top of that, i'm diagnosed with bpd (borderline personality disorder) and truly try to go above and beyond to not be the monster people with bpd are made out to be.   i suffer the mood swings; the infinity on high to wanting to die in 2.5, the severe emotional reactions, the impulses. but i try to keep everything a secret, keep it inside my head. i don't want anyone to be a casualty of my emotions.      my guy is very supportive; he tries to be. he's fairly critical of some things and strongly opinionated. these are things i love about him. sometimes, when i try to express my emotions, he's logical about things; i feel like i'm better off staying silent because i end up feeling worse, through no fault of his. i feel like i'm burdening him with my emotional distress, and that maybe i articulate poorly.      so i do. i say everything is fine. i pushed my friends away because of work taking all my time, and my fear of being an emotional burden       i try to work through it on my own. to stay rational. i don't want to be a monster. people say that those with bpd are egocentric narcissistic monsters. i don't want to be like that.      but by hiding it i feel so fake. like nobody knows who i am. maybe i don't know who i am.       i wanted to be done. i think about suicide often, but i always find a reason not to. i try to have a will to live. i crave affection and appreciation but feel like a leech asking for it, so i try not to.      i didn't kill myself. but i almost do, a lot.           in the end, it comes down to who would feed my cats?      i have to. so i strive on and try for better days. i'll beat this. i have to.      thanks for listening. i just, needed to tell someone i almost killed myself last night. but i didn't.

Neutral	from looking at the calcs, flamethrower didn't look "way worse" but just not as good. the biggest reason to run flamethrower is the accuracy, which the guy mentioned. i don't play competitive much but i do find it annoying with massive damage-dealing moves hit with bad accuracy. fire blast is at least 85 but whenever a stone edge or focus blast hit, i always shake my head.       i understand the guy's logic here. basically, it's a toss-up over whether you go for pure damage and some risk over guaranteed solid damage and no risk. there is no right or wrong answer to this. just how willing are you to play the odds on 85% accuracy is all.

Neutral	at least where i'm from the med schooled doctors suck at research, if it's not something they specifically wanted to do.       it's really not surprising, a physician isn't a scientist and much of the training is doing manual work. even when they get mds they are in many cases for career advancement, not that they want to actually do science.      if you do good research it's going to be hard, no matter what the field is.
Neutral	the us has the best healthcare providers in the whole world, they're just expensive as fuck. btw, they can't actually deny you care if you dont have money. they will just bill the hell out of you after its done. also, they cant charge interest on hospital bills unless you go to a bill consolidation service. which means you can take as long as you want to pay it off. it ain't the best system, monetarily, but you (and said baby) will get the care you need.

Neutral	> the calculus would change dramatically under medicare for all, which would free millions more patients to seek no-cost medical care while slashing hospitals' pay rates and putting up to 1.5 million jobs at stake.      from the article. it would probably put a lot more at stake. medicare pays half of what private insurance does. how will doctors, nurses and hospitals continue to operate when they're only receiving half of what they were?  that not just going to take away their profits, it'll bankrupt them. it'll close hospitals and force doctors and nurses to take other jobs or in other countries.       there are plenty of idiots trying to call the hospitals greedy there. one said something like "i know an independent hospital would love single payer medicare for all" and said many have "relationships" with insurance companies.       no shit. insurance companies pay them. medicare for all would bankrupt them, that's one reason regular insurance is so high. hospitals offset the cost of medicare into private insurance.

Neutral	i've watched a few of his videos, i have a bachelor's in history and from the few movies i watched he either leaves out important bits or twists events in many topics he is "debunking" to fit his narrative. what he says is *technically* true, he skips over a lot of stuff that would have built context and often uses character assassination during his interpretation of events to make a person sound evil when he can't easily debunk something. for example, he was doing a video on crowder's reference to the crusades and he pulled up a map of the records of all battles between muslims and christians during the reconquista, he had no idea what he was looking at(he so focused on the crusades, that the muslim-christian conflict during the 700 year long reconquista never entered his mind) so he called the person who came up with it a white supremacist and moved on as if he had somehow proven him wrong.

Neutral	i had a chemistry test coming up. i didn't do so well on the first one. now is my chance to prove i can do well. i study for a week straight. 4+ hours every day. and i get a 65%. in the car, my dad asks about it. i say i got a 65, which was better than last time, and not an f but a d, and i got my last exam score (55%) replaced with this one. dad asks what i have in thr class, and i say 75%.      mom says "you might want to rethink being a chem major if you can't do community college level chemistry." i'm 17, in high school, and i'm going to a local community college through a program my school offers. she has already brought it up before, and i was really doubting myself. i just say "haha yeah.." because i don't really know what else to say. its been hard motivating myself and finding a goal i want to achieve, but being a biochem major and getting my bachelors degree in science is the one goal i've made for myself. its what i've been working with in mind for the last 2 years at this college. i almost have my associates. and now my mom is telling me i can't achieve my goal.       my dad says "no no she can do it, it will take a little work, but she can do it. everything takes work." i don't say anything because i don't want my mom to keep going on about it. last time she talked about this, i was in the car by myself with her, so i just had to sit and listen to her tell me i'm not good at chemistry, wasn't in high school, isn't now, and why do i want to be a chem major when i'm bad at chemistry. but i felt better about having my dad in the car because he usually says something when my mom goes too far with something.       she always used to ask me why i don't have any goals in life, why i don't care. because whenever i have something i love doing or something i want to work towards, you always walk all over me and make me question whether or not i can do it, whether or not i can do anything.          when i was applying to universities, she said i could apply anywhere, that now was my time to start becoming more mature. she always goes on about how college is my time, my time to do what i want, be who i want to be, and how i can go anywhere.       i said i wanted to apply to uw seattle.       yes, perfect!       i guess i can apply to uw tacoma too. no, you are not applying there!       why not, it has a small school size which is what i want, it's still university of washington thats the one school i have always dreamed of going to every since i was a kid.       because, you are not applying there!!!      i want to apply to both uw's with dorms i've always wanted to go there, xxx (my boyfriend) is going there too!       you know you're not going to be with him when you're in college right, you're not going to be together very long, you know you're not getting married, right? you're going to meet so many new people in college, you think he's not going to meet any new people while he's in college? he's probably met people already (he's a college freshman this year).      she always asks if i have crushes on any of my male friends. asks if i feel anything for them. if there's something between us. i don't understand why. she's not joking. she's being completely serious. it just makes me uncomfortable. and always makes comments about my boyfriend finding someone else to be with at work or at college.      as i was showing her my prom dress, she said,      maybe you'll get to wear it in college, some guy might invite you out to a fancy event!      i'm going to prom with my boyfriend and i have never been more exited to go to a school event. i've never gone to school dances, events, anything. but my boyfriend wanted to share a special day with me, and that's what my mom had to say about it.       i wish she could recognize that i'm happy with him, and even though i know it may not last forever, i can hope it will and appreciate the present. just because you wanted to date a lot in high school and college, doesn't mean i do.       i just needed to vent

Neutral	you are 100% correct. there are other choices. but  the person didnt choose them. and the end result is a life is brought into this world to be fed into a broken system that is not catered to the individual. we expect said system to raise  kids? when it's already failed so many mentally i'll adults?    broken people create broken children. and those broken children live to be 80yrs old. even with a very small sphere of influence that is a lot of fucking time to wreak havoc on the world.   at some point we need to collectively become more objective and decide what the goal truly is. are we trying to punish people who are dumb and lazy?       i don't care where you fall into politics. it doesn't interest me.    morality is a human concept.  if we are to start putting these things on the table for discussion  then our society should also be acknowledging all of the other acts of evil  each one of us commits by proxy just by existing in the first world. because tons of people have died or even worse, suffer on the reg just so you and i can live in comfort.       if your response has anything to do with god, just stop. i cant.

IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	i agree to all that.  destroying is not always needed but some kind of pressure must be applied.          timing is everything.  the ideal time is when a relatively supportive government is comfortably in power and can afford to burn some good will from its supporters.         now is a terrible time to raise minority issues, trump will effortlessly turn them into fuel for the trump train.  he can't be fought on his own ground.  all abusers isolate their victims, and he has done a superb job of isolating his supporters.        causing polarisation is easy and very powerful.   the trick is to recognise or create circumstances where polarising a specific set of issues will wedge opposition or swingable voters into your own camp more than it (and disgust at the tactic) pushes your own people away.     if the issues in the set are synergistic you are unstoppable and immune to scandal.  trump can get away with murder (khashoggi's murder would not have been feasible under a principled president), because he found and exploited a compatible set of wedge issues.          tl;dr   trans people should try to be invisible until this government is gone.  and gays should dress and act like mormons at pride parades.        they should take a lesson from the neo-nazis.  do you see them dressed in their nazi uniforms, goose-stepping and sieg heiling for the tv cameras, claiming the labels nazi, neo-nazi, white supremacist, holocaust denier, alt-right?  nope. they define themselves out of any of those definitions, and deny that "crypto-nazi" even means anything.  if you point out any similarities they say "nazis drink water".   also:  nazis haven't existed since ww2.  neo nazis don't exist because nazis were socialist and who wants that?   nazis are not far-right because socialism, duh.         they will presumably abandon "identarian" once the public learns what it means, or if they can't defend its nature as a form of the "identity politics" they decry.        they are far less hidden since trump came to power but mainly they lay low.     look at the reddit rallying point /frenworld to see how shy they are.

Neutral	the book came out during the lead up to his canonization, so his portrayal in it having critical elements was considered quite controversial at the time of its release.       for example, his narrative arc closes with an appearance to a taoist hermit as a ghost vengefully demanding the return of his head. the hermit, knowing of lord guan's great reputation and famous deeds, asks what about the men whose heads guan had taken himself (he recites an abridged list), who will return them? spurned, the ghost vanishes and lord guan exits the narrative.

Neutral	curious, why would having a single-payer system prevent others from being able to negotiate on the terms of their own health care?      for example, say the government/medicare negotiates with their providers, and hands you a bill saying your treatment costs $1,000. you say, "no thanks", and negotiate with another provider, who gives you a bill of $500, and you choose to pursue that treatment.      i'm assuming that there would be multiple "healthcare providers", i.e., those who procure actual healthcare products and services, not insurance companies (who i assume would be eliminated by medicare-for-all). otherwise, the government would have to nationalize all of these providers if they wanted there to be no other choice.

Neutral	> are the people who focus more heavily on the way that the story illustrates the dangers of censorship (i.e. the vast majority of people who read the book) objectively wrong for doing so?      tbh i actually think fahrenheit 451 isn't a good example for this because the fact that books are burned indiscriminately with no regard to their content or ideas kind of hugely misses the actual dangers of censorship - that those in power can suppress ideas which they see as a threat to power and their status quo. that, combined with that one frankly garbage spell-it-out-for-the-reader scene where the main character directly talks about tv making everyone dumb and berates a woman for having c-sections makes the whole thing seem *exactly* like bradbury's old man rant.

Neutral	  the most infuriating thing bernie's ever said is probably this video. at a speaking engagement in 2016, a woman said that black people in america face specific forms of oppression that other races do not, and she asked to speak about what he would do to help black people specifically. he interrupted her and said       >"you and i may have a disagreement on this," sanders said, "because it's not just black, and it is latino, there are areas in america, including poor rural areas, where it is white. okay?"       he seriously told a black woman he disagrees with her on racism! he told her they had a disagreement on her own life experiences!      the fact that he thinks class is more important than race just displays a poor understanding of both issues.       another classic example of bernie's deliberate cluelessness when it comes to race is is this series of tweets in which, three days before the election in 2016, he said trump supporters are not racist and everyone else has a responsibility to reach out the trump supporters and build a better society for them.       another great example was when he said "there are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an african-american.".       my personal favorite, which is to say least favorite, is the time that an audience member at one of his appearances said she wants to become the second latina senator in us history, and he cut her off to say "it's not good enough for somebody to say 'hey i'm a latina vote for me' that is not good enough."       one that's less serious but still deeply concerning to me personally is this piece of creative writing from him where he describes a woman being bound and gang-raped in graphic detail.  i really just don't trust men who fantasize about abusing women. in my own experience, that fantasy belies some pretty violent subconscious sexism.      this video where he calls asian people "yellows" is also pretty great.       he got trump elected because 1 in 10 of his voters ended up voting for trump.       he also got trump elected because russian propagandists helped him and his campaign . there's a reason that russian trolls knew his voters would be willing to not vote for hillary in the general. he built a coalition of racist white leftists just like donald trump did on the right.       the best evidence that bernie is racist might just be the fact that in the 2016 primary, [he received 23.1% of votes from black voters and hillary clinton won 75.9%]([URL]). black people tend to dislike racism.

Neutral	'fascism' is a very misused word. few can define what it really means, since it's supposed to be something really really bad. the genuine basis for fascism is the petty bourgeoisie, wrote leon trotsky, suggesting it was the over- and middle-class tactic to 'hijack' the true revolution that has to come. a way for the 'parasites' (bourgeoisie) to hang on there in a changing world. 'parasites' is a horrible word to use about people, but if one looks at nature at a tree fungus for instance and think coldly like a scientist, it isn't a bad analogue. it contributes nothing to the trees existance, and in the end will lead to the death of its host.   i recommend trotsky's writings on these matters, there is a book or pamphlet written before the second world war called "what is national socialism" that is still interesting and highly readable.

PersonDirectedAbuse	the appropriate amount of sympathy (and i'm pretty sure you know this) is to not say you don't give a shit about them and is simply to give a shot about them. you don't have to tweet or mourn them but actually care a little bit about the unfortunate circumstances they are in. shut up about virtue signalling, taking about that like i'm on the left and want you to do it, i'm not gonna argue with someone who instantly becomes facetious. false sympathy? if  what i just described is false sympathy to you then i was correct with my original statement. you are unempathetic.

Neutral	here's a hot take (maybe): no one has ever complained about "tone" on reddit in good faith. it is a deflection, always.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	anyone old enough to remember youtube when it was dominated by the likes of *smosh* and other amateur content creators probably scoffs at how *soft* the internet has become. before graduating high school, i had spoken with islamic fundamentalists, spammed the likes of david duke for fun, had no fewer than four people threaten to injure or kill me (one of those also provided a graphic description of how he would rape and kill my family in front of me), and had my first exposure to what would later be deemed by /pol/ as the *schizoboomer* - the archetypal crazy person who insisted to me that he had 'top government contacts' in the british military who *assured him* that the 2012 mayan apocalypse was real and not a viral marketing campaign for a lackluster roland emmerich movie. youtube's moderation staff at the time was notoriously slow, and never really kept up with scale. by around the 2010s, it became obvious to anyone paying attention that youtube had become a sump for some dangerously insane individuals.      it was also obvious that the moderation team could never possibly scale to deal with the completely depersonalized nature of these comment sections - they would have to read the comments to get context on the conversation and *then* ban the offending users, who would have a new account set up in minutes (this was before the move towards 2 factor verification across most services, so it was really, really easy back then, comparable to making a new reddit account today).      this was a problem that social networks and mmos would find increasingly difficult to grapple with, especially as more dedicated persons learned methods of subverting filters and behavior guidelines (the emergence of the now-cheapened term 'trolling,' perhaps best exemplified by the 4chan raids on habbo hotel). it was remarkably easy to get away with this sort of thing at the time.      for youtube, the solution seems to be in a crowd-sourced pseudo-ai analyzing viewing patterns and social networks in order to determine who is likely to constitute an undesirable, and removing them. this, in tandem with surgical bans against particularly egregious focal points of dissidence (e.g. alex jones) has been their operating strategy ever since it became clear that they could never *read* nor even *watch* all the content they were hosting.      reddit has taken another approach. although it has made use of surgical bannings (notably against [USER], [USER], and [USER]), it does not have the resources to make use of the more sophisticated methods used by google. instead, it relies upon simple social manipulation. reddit made two important changes to its platform which all but ensured it was destined to become an echo chamber of its young and left-leaning user base - first, the decision to present upvotes and downvotes *as an aggregate* rather than separately. whereas it had previously been possible to see the numerical level of support *for* or *against* an idea, now it is only possible to view whether or not an idea has positive or negative karma - i.e. it is only possible to see whether or not the majority agreed or disagreed with the idea. the minority opinion thus becomes merely an unpopular opinion - it becomes impossible for the minority to ascertain whether or not there is a minority who actually *support* their ideas.      second comes the cool down timer - when users with negative karma in a subreddit try to make a comment, they are often met with the response that "you are doing that too much. try again in 10 minutes." this was (as far as i understand) originally intended as a hedge against overt trolling and thread derailment, but it has had the effect of creating a series of walled-gardens that no longer really talk to each other outside of dedicated debate subreddits without a clear bias towards one group. once a group comes to dominate the conversation, they begin to 'settle in' to the subreddit and frequent it more ([USER] is an example of what was once a very high quality subreddit with a variety of viewpoints that has recently become dominated by lazily scrawled critiques by 14 year old atheists). it also becomes impossible for unpopular discourse to advance itself, because newer arrivals are downvoted and only have the chance to post six times every hour - this can often lead to situations where multiple people *respond* to an unpopular post, but only one or two get an answer, making it initially appear as though the point has been refuted by virtue of the dissident's silence - it's structurally impossible for them to offer timely replies.      all of this seems to me to be very much intentional - and i don't doubt there will be lots of readers on [USER] who will claim that the system is functioning as intended (because to them, these ideas are invalid and thus should not be engaged with anyways, which incidentally is exactly how we've ended up with so many schizoboomers on /pol/ over the years).

Neutral	i just got laid off. i don't even know what to think, feel, say, do. i've worked for this company for over a year and i got a promotion a few months back and for the first time in a long time i was feeling amazing, not just with my job, but my mental health was the best it has been in a long time and for it to just.. disappear and get that rug pulled from under me so suddenly is just... i dont know. the only word that explains what i feel this exact second is just "numbing". i just feel numb with this whole situation. i already cried, felt sorry for myself, vented with my so. now i got home, and im just sitting in my couch writing this and i just feel. numb.      sorry for the grammar. im not thinking, just, venting it out to get it out of my system.

Neutral	disagree. sorry, not a nurse so i hope i'm not civillian splaining here but...   you have to learn a lot of biology and other sciences to do it, and learn to use a lot of technology. everyone who has a degree to work in allied healthcare, even if what they actually do is mostly physical, has to at least make use of science, technology, and math. it just doesn't require the higher level of understanding that being a doctor does. but i think to say nursing isn't a science is to discredit it. they have done experiments and they have academic journals, there's a lot of science in things like making sure germs don't spread from patient to patient. all the practical stuff nurses think is "common sense" is on a foundation of science. like germ theory.

Neutral	i don't know how this subreddit works but i need to get something off my chest haha      i've been recovered from bulimia for like a year and partially recovered for 2. i've been eating whatever i want because if i try and restrict what i eat, it just sends me down a really unhealthy guilty path that i'm not in the place to go down anymore.       the problem is i've gotten fat. my bmi is technically healthy (23) but we all know it doesn't mean anything. i'm in the middle of some serious exams and i can't excersize right now because i need to study all the time. all i can feel is my legs touching and my stomach rolling on itself and my flabby arms and the extra skin on my back and the flab on my waist and my fat neck. i don't know how much of this is dysmorphia and how much is me being fat, but i'm fine most of the time until it hits me in waves like it is now.       i tried to take some nudes and my body just seemed wrong. i tried to put on a pair of shorts but they've gotten so tight they barely fit. i bought all my clothes when i was bmi 16.5-19 and they're so tight and ill-fitting now, and i can't afford more.      i really just wish i could take a scissors and chop off all the fat. it's so unfair, because whenever i see someone who has told me they recovered from an eating disorder, they look normal. they haven't gained loads of weight like me. i just want to go on a diet, but i promised myself i'd eat whatever i want until the end of this year, to let myself get used to this new body. if i start dieting i'm scared i'll just hate myself more. i'm so annoyed i just wish i didn't feel like this.

[URL]             speculation now has it that someone waaaay up the political food chain may have orchestrated this hoax with jussie as the "actor" in it, and the records were sealed because this person had the clout to do it.   the hoax was to be just another way to smack down trump and his base, but jussie, being fairly stupid, decides to do this in a polar vortex in the area of town where maga folks are harder to find than a public toilet.  not to mention writing a check to his friends to fake the deed....  so who?  who?  just who could be the masterbrain behind this?             would explain:             1. super eddie doing a pressor weeks ago about jussie to give foxx &co. the option of saying jussie was denied due process.  super eddie dose not go out without mayor rham telling him to.  then he is "livid" at the dropped charges, keeping his "law and order" cred intact and ensuring that he will go on to "super" here or elsewhere.  he is also seen as a good political soldier.    2. mayor rahm then acts all offended when the charges are dropped.  he keeps his reputation of "law and order" intact and hits at trump, keeping his left-wing cred intact.              what if the hoaxer was the same hoaxer who had to know of the russian hoax of "collusion" that did not exist, according to sc robert mueller?  what if the master hoaxer had strong ties to chicago and jussie and could get records sealed as easily as he could get them unsealed when he ran for state senator?       is master hoaxer  44?

Slur	r/tinder has been getting honestly misogynistic and red-pilly lately (not that it was a paragon of feminism to begin with, mind you). i've seen comments where the girl being talked to was straight up called "a huge bitch" for not playing along on yet another terrible joke/pickup line.
Neutral	my friend (let's call her c) was basically one of my first friends in college, and she's helped me through a lot of tough shit (depression, anxiety, losing a family member, losing a friend). i've known her since sophomore year, and now we're both seniors. i'm graduating in 2.5 months, but she's staying for a 5th year. most of my friends are juniors or staying for a 5th year, so it's going to be really tough for me to leave my friends behind. my college friends are like my family.      i've also helped c through a nasty breakup with one of her previous girlfriends. because of this, i was happy for her when she got her new girlfriend last year, but now i think things have gotten weird.      she literally spends all her time with her girlfriend. like always. even though c lives with just one other dude, her girlfriend is practically her third roommate, and i know this pisses off c's actual roommate. c's girlfriend doesn't go to college and just lives in the same town we go to school in.      c has just gradually stopped talking to me. she even killed our ~600 day snapchat streak a few months ago for practically no reason. sometimes she'll randomly send me a meme or two on facebook and i'll try to start a conversation with her, but 95% of the time the conversation ends with her leaving me on read.      sometimes, i'll see c's other friends around on campus and they'll ask me if i've ever heard from c, because they haven't. because of this i know this isn't something c's just doing to me, but she's doing this to all her friends.      i'm happy that c is happy in her relationship, but i'm hurt that she's practically cut off myself and all of her other friends. since i'm graduating in a few months, i want to spend as much time with all of my friends as possible before i leave campus. i haven't seen her in months, and i'm worried that if she doesn't get her shit together, i may not see her again before i graduate      **thanks for reading. i know this isn't an advice subreddit, but if anyone's been in a similar situation, let me know how you dealt with it**

Neutral	you're not alone, there are lots of people who are unhappy with life we just don't talk about it. one thing i'll say is try to work on letting go a little, you know, keep from obsessing over things you can't change. all you can do is learn from what you've been through and figure out what you're going to do about your current situation. no human is ever going to be perfect because that's not what it means to be human, we all fuck up, it's ok. you're not entitled for being bothered by these things. your ex didn't take away your chances of being happy and functioning regularly. you can't put your happiness and well-being in the hands of others because there's no guarantee that any realationship will last forever. and even if you didn't end up with the last girl you were talking to, there's going to be another one eventually. but in my opinion you should try to focus more on bettering yourself before you jump straight back into a realationship. that's what i'm doing right now. i know you can't afford rent but maybe get a therapist if you can it can be very helpful if you find a good one. lastly if you really enjoy music you should pursue it for your own sake. sure nothing is going to come out immediately but but give it time, eventually you'll figure out a way to write out what's on your mind. it takes time and effort to get any art form "right" so you should focus on having fun with it while trying to get better. you can't give up just because it doesn't come to you instantly. you sit down everyday and work on it, something will come of that and you will make great music.

Neutral	it has often been claimed that alarm about global warming is supported by observational evidence. i have argued that there is no observational evidence for global-warming alarm: rather, all claims of such evidence rely on invalid statistical analyses.      some people, though, assert that the statistical analyses are valid. those people assert, in particular, that they can determine, via statistical analysis, whether global temperatures have been increasing more than would be reasonably expected by random natural variation. those people do not present any counter to my argument, but they make their assertions anyway.      in response to that, i am sponsoring a contest: the prize is $100 000. anyone who can demonstrate, via statistical analysis, that the increase in global temperatures is probably not due to random natural variation should be able to win the contest.               a time series is any series of measurements taken at regular time intervals. examples include the following: prices on the new york stock exchange at the close of each business day; the total rainfall in england each month; the total wheat harvest in canada each year. another example is the average global temperature each year.      most data sets used in the study of climate are time series. yet there are almost no climate scientists that have competence in the statistical analysis of time series.      statistical incompetence has misled climate scientists into believing that they can distinguish between purely random series and series generated with a trend. the purpose of the contest is to show that such a belief is false, at least for the series of global temperatures.      critique of the statistical analysis done by the ipcc   [URL]      more info   [URL]

Neutral	there is nothing remotely racist about this post.       blacks do go into the woods to enjoy the outdoors through activities like hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, etc... but, blacks only make up about 13% of the population of america. also, not many blacks actually go into the woods; only a very small percentage of them are active in the wild outdoors. therefore, i suspect that of all of the humans that regularly go into the woods in north america, probably less than 1% of them are black.       why bring this up? my point here is that bigfoot is not used to seeing black folks. this may provoke certain responses by a sasquatch when it sees a black person, such as:      1. confusion;   2. fear;    3. trepidation; and   4. curiosity      i believe that all of these are responses that can work to our advantage.  all of these potential responses will cause a bigfoot some amount of pause, and this slight pause may be the difference between getting off a kill shot and not.       the fact is, sasquatch does not regularly see black people. chances are better than not that when a squatch sees a black person that it will be the first time it has ever seen one. it may get scared and freak out, or it may stand there and stare.      as a practical matter i think that a technique worth trying is to take a black person on some hunts. see how the squatch population reacts to the black person and take note. i am aware of no other groups that have tried this, so i will be very interested to see the results.       there are all sorts of variations on this concept. the goal here is to throw a bigfoot off balance with some sort of odd occurrence in the woods. the idea is to create a weird scene in an area where bigfoot are present and which is not threatening to the creature. at the same time, you want it to perplex the bf to the point where it is standing there just scratching its head at the spectacle. while this is going on we will have snipers strategically placed whose job is to locate the sasquatch and to put a bullet in the animal's head.       here are some other ideas i have to cause a bigfoot to pause due to confusion:       1. outdoors sex/orgy: get some skanky swingers group together and get them into the woods to screw and orgy in a bigfoot hotspot. this will really pique a scratch's interest. at some point a squatch will stick out its head to see what the fuck all that sucking and slapping noise is, then one of our snipers blows his brain out!       2. poker game in the woods: same concept as the orgy but less gross. it probably will take longer to attract a squatch.       3. strange looking people: these are people that squatch are not used to seeing. for example, dress up like a party clown and walk around in a hotspot zone juggling bowling pins.       4. fighting: put together a group of low-life fight-club types, take them into the woods and let them fight. the noise and weird scene will generate some bigfoot interest.       some believe that sasquatch are something like forest ninjas: fast and stealthy. i think that if you do something truly weird then we may be able to confuse and agitate the animal. confusion and agitation does not comport with stealth and concealment. therefore, we take the squatch's advantage away from it. this will make it t more likely to show itself and, thereby, give us a shot at it.

IdentityDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	you seem fun and totally well-adjusted!      but seriously, i know that you're still mad at your parents for making you do the dishes after dinner, but that's no reason to waste your energy spreading hysterical hatred on the internet.      your real problem is the same as everyone else in your age group - you have no real problems or perspective on life.        from the climate change hysteria they have spoon-fed you since birth to the fashionable anti-trump fever, you have been conditioned to become a miserable basket case for the social and political benefit of others.  you are being manipulated into a simplistic and foolish view of the world where you are good and *they* are evil.        this isn't one of your comic book fantasies, it is real life.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	that's dyke joke is actually pretty funny, did you think of it for this comment or had you heard it elsewhere?       you're not wrong, but it is true that i got banned and i didn't even have to say a naughty word to do it. the mod read my mind, and even though the joke was well received (and all its comments were negative) banned me anyway. i'd say this qualifies as a power trip and an example of falling standards across the site.       once ever user who uses niggardly is banned across the site, finally reddit will be safe.

Neutral	upon discovery of unauthorized purchases totaling $353,703 by two officers of the organization that occurred in 2017, on or around january 21, 2018, trans lifeline removed these officers from having access to the organization's bank accounts and assets and terminated their employment and their positions as officers after completing its initial investigation of the diversion.  the governing body recovered some of the organization's assets but was unable to recover all of the diverted funds.  on june 28, 2018, the organization and the terminated officers had a mediation where the terminated officers agreed to return the diverted funds over a period of time not to exceed ten years.  it is the organization's assessment that the terminated officers are financially unable to immediately return the diverted funds; however, the organization believes that its best chance at recovering these funds will be to enforce the agreement to recoup the diverted funds over the next ten years.  the organization believes that other possible methods of recovery, including the filing of a lawsuit, will result in further expenditures of the organization's limited funds allocated for critical crisis service of its target population, thereby negatively impacting its ability to carry out its mission and its donors' intent, and will not result in a higher likelihood of recovery of the diverted funds.             rct.doj.ca.gov/verification/web/download.aspx?saveas=ca+returns+signed.pdf&document_id=09027b8f8037295d (it's a long document but the relevant part is on page 2)             the statement from when the founders left a year ago: [URL] (note the complete lack of niceties such as "we wish them the best in their future endeavors")

PersonDirectedAbuse	see this sounds like a good take initially. you have a logical lead up to your conclusion and even arguments. that's more than most "anti sjws" have.      history reveals your words as bollocks, however. every conquest, minor or major, ever made by a marginalized group was achieved not by being polite and appeasing the dominant groups, but by fighting and screaming and destroying. civil rights, stonewall, worker's rights, you name it. if anything the minorities of today aren't doing _enough_. violence _works_. history has proven time and again that violent riots bring progress, being complacent creates stagnation.

Neutral	so i posted   about my account being suspended after i called out the admins in r/modsupport the other day. i then had another account suspended the very next day, brand new account for the same trumped up "ban evasion" bs, i've submitted appeals on every account and emailed as well as contacting the r/modsupport mod mail.        anyway, one of the subs i used to moderate was r/snp which is the subreddit of the scottish national party, of which i am a member. this is the current party in power in the scottish parliament whose ultimate goal is scottish independence. i've come to learn that u/dougal83 is actually a mod and supporter of r/ukipparty. this would be like someone modding r/the_donald and r/the_mueller, or r/liberalism and r/conservative.       i messaged the modmail to get re added and was told that dougal has no intention of re adding me unless a reddit "moderator" (admin) messages them telling them it was in error. now everyone knows reddit admins a) don't discuss actions taken on other users accounts, and b) would never do that.      after calling out the inaccuracy of that statement, i was muted      now this is a small subreddit so not being able to mod it isn't the end of the world as i attend my local branch's meetings consistently and pay dues. but it's a bit rich that people are playing both sides. note when i was first added as a moderator back in october, i simply messaged the mod mail and was added with no questions asked or even a response to the mod mail. just a simple invitation.       edit: conveniently, my cyberstalker commented on this post, lacking any awareness of his surroundings lol, mods please leave the comment up so people can see what i been dealing with first hand. this is a brand new account mind you.

Neutral	i'm incredibly sensitive and gentle..i'm always getting things like "omg i'm not sugarcoating it to protect you wittle heart. grow up".    so i have to toughen up to be accepted. but i have a quote i thought up that i live by daily. *"there is always a kind way to tell the truth"*    you don't need to sugarcoat anything, but there is *always* a nice way to say things.   i wish people would be more thoughtful and considerate, and those people think i'm pathetic for crying a lot and getting hurt by things.       i feel like i will never be accepted with my autism, depression and anxiety. i'm a gentle soul who tries my hardest to be a good person and care for everyone..but when i'm picked on because i'm easily hurt, i retreat and stay hidden for ages.   i hate feeling like i too have to be a loose tongued, unaccepting bigot to be classed as a person. there's never an excuse to make someone cry..  (in the sense of having no filter for your words). please be kind to others guys. your kindness and care could *literally* save someone's life...
Neutral	see i think you're just taking pleasure in fatalism or self pity. shakespeare, though a wonderful literary artist, was more than a bit of a fatalist or nihilist himself. (yet he still managed not to consistently advocate genocide.)      i think you're making your points just to hear yourself talk. they're not particularly sensical. you don't care much for criticism or understanding or addressing contrary points, it's just a one-man show. a party for yourself.      if you take comfort in that, that's fine. but advocating suicide or genocide for others is not fine. if that's all you have to add and if you're not willing to accept or understand views of others, then you should just keep it to yourself.       death itself is not evil, life itself is not evil, death is just a part or conclusion to life. however you can make peace with that, i hope you do. because whatever this thing you have going on is, it's quite negative and quite counterproductive.

Neutral	the thing i find surprising about literacy tests is that they probably could be brought back without constitutional problems. sure, the supreme court has stopped states from using literacy tests to keep racial minorities from voting. for example, it wasn't ok for southern states to combine impossible to pass literacy tests like this one with grandfather clauses that said if your grandfather was eligible to vote (i.e. not a slave) then you could wave the impossible test. but literacy tests applied without racial discrimination have always been upheld.      it was a law, specifically the voting rights act of 1965, that banned literacy tests, not some supreme court ruling. and really, that national ban is probably on shakier constitutional grounds than any neutrally applied literacy test.       so yeah, i still don't think it's a good idea because people would immediately abuse their power to write the test questions, but it would only take a change in legislation to bring the tests back.

Neutral	nah like i consciously knew these people exist. and i've seen em first hand usually in first year social science/gen ed classes but usually not this outwardly dumb. like 7 other people thought "yep i'm sure this random dude on the internet knows more about 9 seperate fields than basically everyone whose devoted their lives to studying them. of course it's rational to think that some random dude debunked decades and centuries of science with the sheer power of his mind"         i mean assuming the dude was fairly rational at some point he had to have taken some classes in these fields right? so did he just assume that because he didn't have to study to get a b- in gen ed sociology that he debunked the field? did he ask leading questions trying to "prove" their professor didn't know what they were talking about and was shut down and that's why he thinks he debunked *entire fields*? did he just never ask any questions and assume that he was smarter? why did he "study" so many fields? why just these social science? is he smart enough to debunk all these but economics and history are valid? what are the differences between the ones he liked and the ones he doesn't? *how* would he study 8+ fields well enough that he felt he has a basic grasp of it let alone enough knowledge to again *completely debunk centuries worth of research* just because he felt like it. so many questions
Neutral	democracy sucks

Neutral	thank you for that. i am dyslexic and just make flat out mistakes that i can not see. i do still know what i am talking about, and have relatively good grasp on grammar so that my crap is understandable at least (with context clues). but that does not make me dumb or uneducated in a subject.      again, thank you for defending me.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	after witnessing the crocodile tears she displayed during this incredibly cold, calculated stunt, i think it's safe to say aoc definitely belongs in politics. i cant tell if i'm more disgusted or impressed at her willingness to debase herself in order to score political points/validation from the "human" wet flecks of jizzum that make up her fanbase.
Neutral	it'a a hard knock life in bpt, where they attempt to discern if beyonce is not so crazy in love with jay z leaning over her to talk to another woman. things get sasha fierce, but there remains some reasonable doubt.
Neutral	i definitely think there is something going on at the poles.... if u look at other planets like saturn or jupiter they got lots of weird activity at the poles like the giant hexagon/saturn or swastika/jupiter. i'm sure there is stuff at the poles that is censored.      also, think of some of the more sketchy or "illuminati/mason" linked countries at the far south, there is argentina which was a nazi refuge, south africa which was the main african country that euro imperial/colonists kept and didn't give back, and australia/new zealand the old prison colony which has that huge s spy base to monitor those t data cables. it's like they are the gatekeepers to antarctica.       i like the idea of things like mount meru or some of the ideas of hollow earth, which is not what u think. imagine multiple cones/pyramids , some inverted and stacked onto each other, like those russian dolls that have smaller versions inside, which fits with the idea of afractal based earth. but anyways, i think there is a cone or cylinder type tunnel that runs from south to north, and helps too channel or recycle the atmosphere or electro magnetic energy, and spits it out in the north to make the aurora northern lights. just think of how your body has one huge tube, your inner gut lining, and the north pole is the asshole farting out green particles. the asshole being in the north and not the south plays intro the whole inversion stuff, at least that's how i see it since it seems like more focus is always put on the north and south pole barely getss mentioned.       i would not be surprised if there is tropical land in antarctica, possibly on a plateau, as well as north canada which has some bizarre stories as well as a very odd and interesting gravity anomaly. there is also a few islands in the south that are super curious, including one in the indian ocean between africa and australia that is barely noticeable on maps but rumored to be a cia base as there is a ton of radio and internet traffic that comes out of there and a small colony of "researchers" who live there.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	> i mean just look at what our dumbass diverse european forefathers do to the poor native americans      you mean conquered a people with a "let them all in" shit immigration policy?      > whats the harm if people like mexicans and middle easterners also join us and enrich our culture some more      see above.       also how horrible that i want people to only come here legally and not invade us like the barbarian horde they are.

Neutral	people who believe this stuff don't think, they just want something to hate. i get it, r/politics is nuts, i read the same stuff you guys do and it is really depressing but it is not a mindset conservatives are somehow immune to and were actually sort of close to matching just a few years ago. if you create echo chambers where dissent is reflexively attacked and buried and dissenters are dehumanized, this is the kind of behavior you get.
Neutral	i miss it too :(

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	the left is riddled with muslims. and thus anti-semitism.       i'm not american, so i don't care what they do or don't on your soil. my issue is that israel is the only non shithole country in the region. that affords its terrorist inhabitants more rights than their native countries.       being anti israel is like being pro muslim. you're just supporting inbreeding and terrorism to score brownie points with people who hate you.

Neutral	> but was a lowly bartender who could not even manage her rent.      perhaps i'm too judgemental but as far as i'm concerned there's something seriously wrong with anyone who has a 4 year degree and is still working a service industry job.  either you're not motivated, have a useless degree, or the job enables your self-destructive lifestyle (i.e. you're a bartender because it allows you to drink with impunity).       i understand that money is a factor but there's no upward mobility and any sort of office job is going to offer a better chance to transition into your field of interest.

Neutral	i have a question. why would anyone use that godawful font?
Neutral	i'd say i lean libertarian, but this argument has a little more nuance.      in the classic case of baking a cake, i support the private company's right to refuse, seeing as doing so doesn't violate anybody's individual rights.      however, censoring viewpoints is restricting the freedom of speech. it wouldn't be fair for a bakery to say you can't have a conversation about a political ideology in their shop. if you're not harming anybody, it wouldn't be right for them to restrict your ability to speak about it.       hope that analogy makes sense.
Neutral	it's probably the majority of people here. no one ever wants to discuss anything in any of the threads. i think people come to subs like this to rage, and so they just feed off of the anger and make as much drama as they can.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	suicide is contagious. it's how that evil movie "13 reasons why" caused a spike in suicides of young girls (i wonder if the dutch girl watched it?) and why we're not supposed to report the names of mass shooters (usually not a problem, as 96% of mass shooters are black and nobody knows that).
Neutral	>(gender)      reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Neutral	yeah, they're definitely cheaper in the long run, too. i didn't intend to suggest that one *couldn't* find them at all anymore, just that they aren't the preferred choice for most people.      i wish they were more popular, though. the waste from disposables is awful.
Neutral	i've never been married, so i can't really speak from experience. first of all, my heart is with you brother, this can't be an easy thing to deal with everyday. i could give you loads of advice and words, but words just don't come near what you are experiencing and feeling. i always said cheating is the "mortal sin" of a relationship (if the terms are monogamous of course), and it is the biggest trust killer for said relationship. ask yourself: "do you love her enough to stay with her?", "do you and can trust her again?", "is she worth it?" i'd say if at least one of these answers is no, you should move on and be the best damn father you can be, that's more important now. misery is not a requirement in life, and her vows were already broken, don't put yourself through misery brother. hope all is well, and good luck.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	>last year around august, [one teen vogue writer advocated making up gender-neutral words for family members to "avoid erasing women and non-binary people"]([URL]) because apparently words like "mother," "sister," "wife," "aunt" and so on erase women.      mm. love the logic behind that.

"in good faith" it's reddit not an investment loan.      everyone here knows how dumb that sounds.      > vote ukip      you're not even an snp member, you're a fucking joke. get fucked.

Neutral	i'm in a field that is super competitive and cut throat. due to that, i've held this job out of college for a year. while it has given me great, high profile experience, it has also abused my rights as an employee. i'm talking expected unpaid overtime, being 10-99 employees even though were 40-60 hours a week, and low salary in general.      it's a startup- so these people rely on me heavily for everything day to day, with no real replacement in sight. the owner once said to give him 2 months notice when i leave, instead of two weeks. little do they know next monday i will put in my two weeks notice and fly off free like the winged falcon i was always meant to be.       it's super scary, but i'm going to pursue full time freelance in my field. i have built up a great network and already have clients lined up. i'll be able to set my own schedule, be my own boss, all while working from wherever i want.       i guess i'm just lm just ranting here, but i havent told many people yet and am super nervous to quit my first job. wish me luck!

Neutral	i don't know. can you style deleted/removed comments with a subreddit's style sheet to hide them?      if i went to an askscience thread or something and saw only the 'approved' answers instead of pages of deleted posts, i'd probably actually read it. instead i see an intriguing question and after 30 seconds of scrolling and seeing a bunch of out of context posts and deleted comments i give up. if i really care i'll google the answer.      this way if you cared, you could turn off the subreddit's css and see all the deleted posts, or you can keep it on and be blissfully ignorant and just look at the actual responses.
Neutral	because truth comes a distant second to the important emotional task of being seen to be righteous. if you get found out you can just get all indignant about people trying to "derail" or something, thus somehow proving your point (which doesn't need proving anyway because you _feel_ so strongly about it).

Neutral	i'll get one thing out of the way. i don't hate cats. they're living things, and deserve to be taken care of and nurtured. but that's a job for someone else. i just despise living with them.      right now i live with a cat, not mine. i hate being bitten and scratched. i'm terrified to pet him because it's only a matter of time. i hate how he seems so ungrateful yet demanding. i'm so scared to move a lot near him because he'll jump at me and  scratch at any part of my body that moves too much. i wish people would stop calling these things cute, because now this is the only place i can turn to to confess my emotions. people say "oh haha i'm my cat's pet, he's such a mean little cat" but that just sounds so unpleasant.      maybe it's just me. i'm dealing with a lot and through my life have dealt with a lot of things which have caused a lot of emotional trauma. the way that cats seem to want to be around me yet hurt me, and to love them means to get hurt again, it doesn't bring back good memories.      i'd much rather have a dog. dogs are happy to see you. dogs cuddle and are gentle the whole time. i feel safe around dogs. and i'm sure cats are loving, but i just don't feel it from them. i don't want to love something that will hurt me and act like they don't want to be there.
Neutral	and you know this based on your extensive study and expertise on mental illness and recovery treatments right? you aren't just saying this because it confirms preexisting biases on the mentally ill? because that would be ridiculous and fit the bill for that sub.
Neutral	the point is that self-identified socialists do not recognize the nordic model as a legitimate implementation of their ideology. and a lot of the hip leftists think the nordic model is awesome, so it can't be because they're trying to distance themselves from an embarrassing failure as in the case of the soviet union.
Neutral	oh come on. i'm infertile, that joke is harmless. i've seen a lot more hateful pranks in college, my dorm mate's laundry detergent was refilled with straight bleach as a 'prank'. she smelled it a second after pouring it in, but the damage was already done to the top shirts in the load.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	game sales do not go directly to the developers the developers have already been paid for by developing the game and the money made from selling the games goes to the publisher and shareholders developers only get a cut as a bonus that can vary unless the developers is independent then a significant portion of sales do go to them and a sum to their shareholders now on the note of epics claim that they are helping developers is a flat out lie i don't think terrorizing consumers by holding their products hostage behind an exclusivity deal, cutting their audience right down the middle by removing the freedom to choose, staining their name by associating them with terrorist  and destroying their credibility is a good thing for developers if you do you are fucking retarded.             edit: forgot to add that the first part of the above was something i just read about and if i am wrong please inform me so i may correct myself and two the second part is still valid.

PersonDirectedAbuse	trump works on the level of emotional truths not external facts.  emotions like anxiety, fear, xenophobia, anger are very primitive, they go back to long before we were even human.  mostly before we were primates, i'd guess.     the "logic" used by emotions is largely association, and trump is very skilled at that type of logic.               try not using "post-truth" as a smug insult and excuse for inaction outside your own circle, but as a realistic description of the world you live in.   maybe you can think of ways to make that world better.

Neutral	tw: spoilers for get out      i saw the movie, but it really wasn't as innovative or interesting as people think it is. it's a solid movie and a good directorial debut, and rather fun as a popcorn flick, but to imply that it's some great work of cinema because it starred black people is jumping the gun a little.      it also kind of annoyed me how when the protagonist is invited to a predominantly white gathering, he is immediately apprehensive, and that racist bias is confirmed due to the plot.       the ending was also trite and uninteresting: the protagonist just...hits people and leaves. there's nothing new or novel and anything interesting the movie had to offer was over 10 minutes ago when the family's true intentions were revealed.

Neutral	i haven't read naruto, but based on what you're saying i'd argue that the saiyan reveal was pulled off a lot better for a few reasons:      a) goku was clearly already a weirdo - dude was born with a monkey tail and was super strong even before any training with no real explanation.      b) the series makes a point out of the fact that he was considered a weakling for a saiyan - he still trained really hard to get to where he is.
Neutral	i think the idea that people consider herd immunity complete immunity from a disease is a bit of a straw man.      it was always my understanding (and i assumed that of other people talking about it) that getting a certain percentage of the population immunized was liking cutting fire breaks in a forested area. fire breaks don't keep trees from burning, but they slow or stop the spread of a fire that does start and makes it easier to keep things localized.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	from what i've been hearing, apparently the movie itself contains very little sjw crap. but you wouldn't know that looking at everything surrounding it, from cheese larson saying she doesn't like white dudes to be movie critics because some movies "were not made for them" to cheese and one of the movie's co-directors saying the movie is officially a "feminist movie." basically, they marketed it as being all about girl power. nobody has a problem with girl power. what people don't like is having girl power - or any agenda - shoved down their throats when they go to watch a movie about aliens and exploding spaceships. when some people dared to say so, they were - predictablty - attacked as misogynists and racists and incels and nazis and whatever etc etc. so that blew the whole thing up before the movie was even released.      then there was the whole thing about rottentomatoes changing its entire site functions in order to protect the movie from a negative want-to-see score and later a negative audience review score. yes, that's true. go open up that can of worms if you dare.

Neutral	i agree, its like a meme and the wording itself is misleading.  herd immunity suggests immunity which itself is misleading for the masses that often don't read articles.        oxford states that 80% is effective for most diseases and perhaps 90-95% for more virulent diseases.  which i think that nationwide rates are right around there.        but no one realizes that this will not prevent diseases from occurring in your population, no matter how many people you vaccinate you cannot prevent every disease, this is just ludicrous.         i figured that this topic should be discussed as it will likely stop a lot of people in their tracks.

Neutral	the guy who landed a small plane in red square central moscow in 1987 was really doing so under guidance of the us in a joint us/russian effort for disarmament.      coincidentally the trolleybus guide wires on the street in moscow were down for maintenance for the day when he landed.      coincidentally, he made it through soviet air defenses undetected... or maybe, someone high up was instructed to ignore the small plane?      there's also suspicions he made an intermediate stop near novgorod. what for? no one's talking about it      coincidentally, his landing and 'breaching' of air defenses allowed for dismissal of various key political figures in the ussr, resulting in disarmament treaties.      a lot of details in the official story simply don't make sense.
Neutral	i'm not in any way a believer of acab, and i firmly believe that the vast majority of problems with the criminal justice system originate in the legislature/courthouse, but even the people who do were being pretty damn civil about it itt - at worst making some very mildly sarcastic/snarky remarks. i wouldn't be a real supporter of free speech if i didn't support it for people i disagree with, and the logic for locking it was "y'all can't stay calm" - but pretty much every single person was staying calm, no ad hominem, very little swearing if any, and just generally civil and reasoned discussion of opposing ideas.      if they had locked it for off-topic discussion, politics, etc. that would be one thing but the "y'all can't behave" line is getting pretty damn tired, especially when it's used for people who are objectively behaving in a civil and reasonable fashion. i didn't even get a chance to join in the discussion, and the thread has nearly 1k upvotes in 5 hours which is pretty high for that sub. it's the highest-voted thread from today on the front page.

Neutral	[sorry, mini-novel alert]   woah, woah woah! i was with you for a second but then you opened a behemoth of an already transpiring  slippery slope that leads to a nightmarish rabbit hole...    you see at first i was thinking that a celebrity or social influencer of some sort could definitely negotiate for higher percentages from having their data sold, but then it led into the reality that is *social credit.* (not to mention, the assertions of the naturalized citizen movement that indeed our birth certificates are publicly traded and we are mere chattel)       allow me to explain:   so we see in china that they are beta testing a social credit system. this is an awful reality featured in black mirror, which is nothing but overt predictive programming masquerading as sci-fi...       among many other classified functions, 5g will also operate as a total surveillance system with real-time 3d mapping. however it has also been said that it will implement our eventual social credit system. no more anonymity...       damn! this is exactly what reddit also functions as in a rudimentary way. we are rated with our karma and are rewarded with greater preference or influence based upon higher positives.      the like to dislike ratio of social media was one of the earliest conditioning methods. lyft and uber have taken it further where the consumer themselves can be rated based on their behavior with the driver. same thing with delivery apps or online shopping/ bartering apps. not to mention, apple has admittedly been rating its users based on their interactions with their devices both positive and negative.       watch. it's going to be completely voluntary, at first. i think facebook will initiate. it will seem like a game and those who participate will rate one another in real time and then companies will start to offer discounts or perks to those who have good ratings. all in good fun though!      it will all be downhill from there. fart accidentally in a quiet meeting, lower rating. get angry with the desk clerk, bad rating. question authority, really bad rating. accumulate enough "infractions" and your travel pass is denied. employment terminated, the possibilities are endless...and terrifying.      back to the original, fuck yeah we need a class action lawsuit! all i specialize in is useless bird law so i can't help out. corporate reparations for everyone!

Neutral	of which the owners of said movie decided there should be changes. heck in the animated original, ariel was gonna have blonde hair because the source material had her with such. i don't see you screaming about that change or the changes made from the source material, the little mermaid released in 1837 by hans christian andersen.      if you were about accuracy, you would be blasting disney for how much it deviated from the original story with its 1989 animated release. lets be honest, this isn't about accuracy, this about you not liking the change in general. you don't get to scream about accuracy when your reference point isn't accurate at all either. you are barking up the wrong tree by dying on a hill for a company(disney) who have a long history of taking liberties in how they represent old fairy tales to the public. ariel getting a skin color change is just another in an long line and a relative benign one. it's something called disneyifcation, google it up.      you might want to also cut down on the ableist insults.      source: [URL]      [URL]      [[URL]]([URL])      [[URL]]([URL])      edit: her name.

Neutral	i am experiencing the exact same thing right now.  i've taken myself down to 2 days a week because my job, while pretty stress free and easy, is giving me horrible anxiety.  i live in a severely overcrowded college town, people are generally awful, parking is non existent, and it costs me $10 a day in parking to even go to work.  driving takes all of my mental energy.  it's getting to the point where leaving my house and driving takes 2 days of recovery, afterward.  i'm not a people person, have a ged, have physical limitations, hate talking on the phone, and driving a long commute is impossible in my current headspace.  it's really limiting what i can do career-wise.  my mother passed away last year and left some money behind, so my plan is to buy a house where i can start a greenhouse.  its already become incredibly clear to me that i cant go back to "salmoning" in a city i hate, at a job i'm just completely over.  i have to make my own way from now on.  it has inspired me to start being creative and motivated again.  i'm just biding my time and trying to figure out as much as i can while i get myself ready for the next chapter.  i guess my only advice is to find something you are passionate about that can be lucrative for you.  for me, its growing rare plants.  try doing some freelance or flex jobs if you have useful skills.  take some classes for degrees that allow you to work from home or freelance.  that's something i have been considering as a back up plan.

Neutral	i get why people get a little confused though. you see bigger numbers so your brain says that means it's more, except you forgot determine gross vs. net. and even the difference between gross profit and profit margin. learning this is not a requirement in american schools. i actually wonder if that's intentional too because it means poor people have less of an understanding of just how badly they're being screwed and underpaid.

Neutral	the westernization of chinese food in america is actually a great example of cultural diffusion, combining two entirely different cultures together. just throwing my two cents in. i suggest ramsay work with actual chinese people experienced in making their food to make the food extremely authentic, if not it would be just the same as the chinese food you find in, say, a local chinese restaurant in missouri. i'm not asian but i think that's the best course of action.

Neutral	>  a popular myth is that lucifer is the god of freemasonry, which is true, their version of lucifer is that of a benevolent being who represents knowledge and truth      first, idk if you know what a myth means if you used 'myth' and 'true' in the same sentence.       secondly,       we do not believe that lucifer is the god of freemasonry. what on earth made you think that?       >  they believe a true mason must constantly seek knowledge for the sake of others.      we do not say this, or anything like this. but i mean, that doesn't sound like a bad thing? oh darn here go learn something?      > good example of those high ranking masons could be the british royal family, like prince william and queen elizabeth      neither of those people are masons. the duke of kent is the grand master of england, but a 30 second google search will show you that it's more of an honorary role for him, and much different to those in the usa.       > even thought they deny it, they have a tendency for the occult and of keeping secrets      what friggin mason is denying that we're keeping secrets??? that's literally out thing!! lol

Neutral	i think the idea of duality explains the nature of freemasonry very well. we've all heard stories about freemasons being involved in a lot of conspiracies and the like so i studied a little and i've met quite a few low level masons myself. even thought they deny it, they have a tendency for the occult and of keeping secrets, but overall freemasonry teaches them a lot of good things. a popular myth is that lucifer is the god of freemasonry, which is true, their version of lucifer is that of a benevolent being who represents knowledge and truth and they believe a true mason must constantly seek knowledge for the sake of others. the same thing can't be said about the high ranking masons, who worship a lot of wicked deities.      a good example of those high ranking masons could be the british royal family, like prince william and queen elizabeth, because a lot of members of that family are 32-33 degree masons, the rothschilds themselves have married with the british royals and they have married with a lot of the european noble families over time, like the aldobrandini family, which is part of the italian/black nobility families. so their wealth has grown over time. the rothschilds were involved in grooming clinton for presidency months before she launched her candidacy. and they also bailed out trump when he almost broke his father's business so they've been involved with a lot of politicians and it's safe to say a lot of those nobles i mentioned before are involved in the whole mess too.      so you see, both the stories about freemasonry being a friendly fraternity with slight occult leanings and the ones of the masons being dark occultist being involved in conspiracies are true simultaneously. that's why i consider freemasonry to be a secret society despite the fact that a lot of masons like to sell themselves as being part of an "open society". keeping secrets is common for even the low level members and the high level members are involved in a lot of corrupt things.      what interesting facts do you know about freemasonry and other secret societies?

Neutral	not gonna lie, for like the last 3 years, depression was kicking my ass. i was out of shape and miserable all the time. i was stuck in a downward spiral of self pity and loathing and it only made my condition worse.      something clicked  a couple months ago. i think i realized what i was doing- i had pushed away so many loving individuals while gaining weight and playing too many videogames. i figured that the only person who could help me get out of this loop was myself. i decided i would eat better, go to the gym, and reconnect with those i pushed away.      back to the pull up- with the help of some buddies i started exercising regularly. when i started, i absolutely hated it. but i kept going to the gym every day, and got stronger and stronger which led to today, i was finally able to do 2 full range of motion pull ups without any kind of resistance band or kip up!      im really proud of myself for this. im still a chubby dude (5 foot 8 in, 165 lbs), but its so cool to see myself improve. just a couple months ago, i was a fat stereotypical asian gamer lookin dude. but a couple days ago, i got complimented on my new (albeit chunky) muscle definition, and goddamn it feels good!      its not like ive eliminated all my flaws. i still stress eat and sleep too little. i still occasionally try too hard to be the funniest person in the room, and project myself onto others. but its baby steps, ya feel? slowly but surely, im improving myself!      its just a fucking pull up but it really means so much more to me. it really feels like ive succeeded at something for the first time in forever. its the first step towards feeling happy, and normal.         sorry if this is braggadocious, im just really proud of how far ive come! :)            p.s. if anyone has any tips on eating clean then please help me out! anything is appreciated :)

Neutral	> like i can agree that our society values the feelings of women more than of men      does it? the last few thousand years of history were written by men about the deeds of other men. *maybe* right now, in 2019, society and culture cares what women think and feel. but it's only been like that for...a few years? if at all? (i mean, it's debatable that society and culture cares more about women than it does men....). for literally thousands of years in the west, women were largely relegated to second-class status while we were told that what men did and thought was very, very important. men's bodies and feelings were valued a lot more than women's bodies and feelings. it's only been a very, very short window of time when women were even considered to be *equal* to men....and somehow men are interpreting that to mean that women are valued more than men?      i think the issue here is that a lot of men on reddit have a very peculiar and incomplete view of human history

Neutral	don't know if your still searching the job market but:      i was kind of in a similar situation to yours. got rejected from a 3d art school, and they pretty much took anyone so i felt like shit. at that point i had also been looking for employment for more than a year and i just kept getting rejected/no answer.      i eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (artella.com). this was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. at this point i was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc.       getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, i really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most vfx houses). someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/vfx.      you tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. i was fully aware of that when i was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. but i wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. sure there are people that grow out it, but i've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years.      keep improving, keep applying, and approach recruiters on linkedin informally, have chats with them about future opportunities. they're a lot more friendly than most people realize ;)       best of luck.

Neutral	the one that gets me is "i don't hate them, i just make fun of otherkin!" and i'm thinking...if the person isn't doing harm to anyone else, why do you think "i'm not really bullying this one person by calling them a degenerate, i'm just making fun of a slightly different group of people" is the gotcha to shut everyone down?      if you think lgbtq people are closeted a lot, just wait until you see how many lgbtq furries are closeted, and i'm guessing you got your stats from that same poll that indicates that the rates of being closeted skyrocket even higher if you're both lgbtq and a furry.      people like sonic fox and the like being able to display themselves publicly because they can feel comfortable enough knowing their existence isn't a crime or having fur cons is a big deal because dipshits dumping on furries.      it's one of those things where even if a "furries aren't people" joke doesn't seem like a big deal, if you've interacted with enough people, odds are you've run into a furry sooner or later.
Neutral	ah. to be entirely fair, a lot of his female/feminine characters tend to look really similar if they don't have a unique physical feature. a lot of the side characters i end up mixing up from that. though i'm still certain several characters made it a point to mention how beautiful the character was, and even had a proposal from some sumo wrestler or something.

Neutral	hate hoaxes attack both the group framed by the hoaxed attack, and secondarily harm the very community the hoaxer intended to "help" by wasting of resources. everybody takes a hit.       there's a tendency to dismiss the crime among the hoxer's demographic, "i can understand why." no, your group was made to look the fool, and you made your neighborhood worse.       the way to reduce this type of crime is to understand that nobody wins. it should be toxic to both parties.
Neutral	the removal and censorship was pretty counter intuitive. people that actually enjoy watching people die will go to places like bestgore and other weirdo gore websites full of people that get a kick out of watching people get ripped apart. the subreddit was nice because you could see how this stuff happened easily because it would appear in your home feed sometimes and if you didn't wan't to see it you could just scroll. hiding the fact that car crashes are a thing and people will die in accidents is stupid. r/watchpeopledie was well moderated and didn't have the toxicity of other websites. now if i want to see that stuff i have to go out of my way and look it up on different websites which isn't easily done on mobile.

Neutral	first of all, i don't know if the girl even wants me as a friend. sometimes she takes one, two days to answer my messages. but she always answers, so i guess she is at least a tiny bit interested in talking to me. otherwise she'd already have ghosted me. however, i do recognise that i might have driven her away a bit by avoiding to see her back then.      i went to a therapist back when i was 17 to talk about this and some other, darker, things. she ended up saying that she didn't treat troubles as bad as mine, gave me another place's number & charged me anyway. i'll never go to a therapist again, since she was not the first one i went to during my life. i went to one when i was 5, another one when i was 12 and another one when i was 14. neither one of them were able to help me at all with the issue i faced at the time (i don't quite remember why i went when i was 5 but the other two times were because of anger management issues).       last year i thought of fixing my anxiety myself with meds since it got really bad (i got to the point of stuttering once when talking to two girls and one guy), but i couldn't find any pharmacy willing to sell them to me without a prescription so i couldn't do anything about it.      i don't know if i like anything about myself. i'm a good friend, i guess? back when i had friends i always stood by their side and always listened to them when they had some sort of problem. but i don't know... i was always the one initiating conversations & when i decided to let them start one i never heard from them again.      and about my life... i don't know. the only things i can come up with are material things such as not having to work like most people my age and having two cars for myself (whereas most people my age have to use public transport) but i guess these don't count. i don't have much going on.
Neutral	i guess you're in the last category.
Neutral	well, i'd say regardless, it's easy as fuck to get painkillers. it was easier before the epidemic. any blue collar worker discussing his soreness and torn muscles could easily obtain yearly supplies of painkillers from certain doctors.      people came to rely on this miracle drug to end their back pain, grinding joints, and whatever ailment they had so they can get back up and functional.      op is trying to connect those long hours to painkiller usage, i'm just providing how easy it is for these pills to end up in workers hands.

Neutral	naruto had always really been a story about basically-wizards, let's be honest. i was cool with the explosion of power as it went on mostly because the fights didnt become caricatures because of it-- it just added a lot of bombast.      bleach is an example of power creep gone to hell. the final (manga) arc of bleach especially devolves into everyone developing 11th hour power ups roughly three times per fight, and the final big bad himself was quite literally impossible to beat without an asspull. (as in, he was revealed to be able to not only see the future, but decide what the future would be, even when dead. completely omnipotent.)
Neutral	you can only take one in your raft at a time.
Neutral	i've been considering the neoluddite position recently, and i'm not sure i'm convinced. abandoning technologies because we don't like what they do to us is a principled position, sure, but it's not a winning position. those who abandon the efficiency monster are subjugated and subsequently die out.      still, it seems like critique can only take us so far - we can reveal the man behind the curtain - expose the system for what it *really is,* but once we become the architects of a new system, it is subject to the exact same process of critique. this does seem preferable to dying out, but it seems disconcerting to most people - to propose any new system is to presuppose a notion of what is good, but to acknowledge that the system might one day be overturned is to acknowledge that one's conception of the good is ultimately subjective hogwash.      personally, i've been turning more towards theologians to find an answer to the problem, but your mileage may vary.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	^(let me break it down)             virtue signaling as opposed to bravado.       the internet is perception and perception is dominated by feelings.      women have monopoly over feelings.       men populate the internet.       weak men are subservient to women.       weak men are the majority of men.       add up all these variables and we get women spouting solipsistic self serving shit,       and weak men virtue signaling for some crumbs.             ***whole thing is tiresomely predictable.***
IdentityDirectedAbuse	i thought state-issued sex slaves was part of the western incel platform too.      edit: i've never really thought about it much and unfortunately i'm banned at most every lefty sub but the incel-marxist argument would be fun to troll communists with just to see where they would draw the line on body-autonomy since i never see it brought up by them. why should your body be the one thing you are allowed to own? it's a resource that should be owned by the state and distributed in whichever way is going to benefit society the most. being pro-choice shouldn't be a thing in a communist society. chad hitting the genetic lottery is no different than being born a billionaire's son.      >incels rise up! overthrow the genetic bourgeoisie! a tendie in every pot and a virginal, pubescent stacy in every rape dungeon!

IdentityDirectedAbuse	yeah, guess robert paxton and other academics that specialize in fascism are just retarded.      this is my biggest issue on this sub, people with no formal education on a subject mistaking actual facts for ignorance because again, they have no formal education on the subject.      fascism is completely fluid, that's why you identify fascism using a set of emotional traits and national mood.      >  even scholars who specialize in the quest for fascism's intellectual and cultural origins, such as george mosse, declare that the establishment of a "mood" is more important than "the search for some individual precursors." in that sense too, fascism is more plausibly linked to a set of "mobilizing passions" that shape fascist action than to a consistent and fully articulated philosophy. at bottom is a passionate nationalism. allied to it is a conspiratorial and manichean view of history as a battle between the good and evil camps, between the pure and the corrupt, in which one's own community or nation has been the victim. in this darwinian narrative, the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers who lack the necessary sense of community.      the anatomy of fascism.

Neutral	>one that doesn't apply to other relationships in problematic ways      well there's the power dynamic argument. there are incestuous relationships without obvious power imbalances, but i would argue that all of them have some degree of it, though some is stemming from the fact that it's a societal taboo.      >risk of birth defects      i think this is a bit of a simplification. inbreeding is more harmful as a practice than the individual instances. while contraception makes this less of a moral argument against individual instances, comparing it to people with dwarfism having sex is a bit misleading. though on a related note: this movie is hilariously bad.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	no, there are plenty of lazy and dumb women.  when you get far away from the mean, you find more men.  this is because men have a larger standard deviation in the intelligence distribution.  further, men are more competitive than women.  among other things, this drives them to seek out the best positions, work more overtime, and delay having a family.  sure, a few women will have the intelligence and drive to be a doctor, but at a lower rate than men.

Neutral	my best guess is that either he has a hard time finding a girlfriend and/or is always single, so hanging out with his friends is like the only socializing he gets. it's understandable, but obviously he should be happy for his friend that he has a girlfriend, not upset at him for supposedly "neglecting" him. that's why "bros before hoes" is such bullshit. i'd never get mad at a female friend for not hanging out with me as much because they're busy having a boyfriend, husband, or family. i'd be happy for them and understand.      for whatever reason it seems like men have a harder time coming to terms with their feelings towards their male friends because "no homo" so they just freak out and lash out at them instead of just like, communicating to them about it calmly.

Neutral	yeah. and the hilarious part is a lot of the times, these sjws aren't the race of the people they're trying to defend. like there was this one case of some creeps taking a picture from facebook of a little girl in a kimono, having a tea ceremony for her birthday party because according to her parents, she was into japan. people were shrieking about how this little kid who was maybe eight at most and her parents were racist. and then this japanese person from japan replied and pointed out that japanese people loved people of other ethnicities wearing kimonos and that they were even sold and gifted. even pointed out how respectful the little girl was being.      and i know if my friend since middle school who is chinese knew of people trying to act like white people eating chinese food was a bad thing, she'd be very confused and annoyed.

Neutral	chesterfield county, va. (wric) — a chesterfield family spoke with 8news friday after fending off a naked intruder who broke into their home on south twilight lane the night before. the intruder claimed to be the devil and attacked the family, prompting the homeowner to fire 39 rounds.      the incident was a traumatic experience for the lewis family's first night in their brand new home.         "she was in to kill us," melissa lewis said. "that was her almighty, to kill us. she attacked us and i held her down just kept on punching her and punching her as hard as i possibly could."      the lewis' dream home now looks like a war zone, with blood soaked into the carpet, the walls and windows riddled with bullets and shell casings scattered all over.      "i said 'who are you?" lewis' husband, who did not wish to go on camera, explained. "she said 'i need your help, please help me.' i said 'get out of my house,' and she goes 'i'm the devil.'"         the homeowner says the woman, who had a blue ponytail, broke into the basement around 10:30 p.m. on july 4. the family said she was laughing menacingly and refused to leave.      "she looked possessed, her eyes were completely black, like saucers, and she was laughing like it was a joke," lewis's husband told 8news.      fearing for his life, the father of three grabbed his pistol and gave a verbal warning to the woman. with his family sleeping upstairs, he opened fire hoping to scare her off. none of the shots struck the suspect.      lewis said the woman aggressively charged at him with superhuman strength.      "she was not stopping," he said. "she had the strength of four grown men."      when he ran out of bullets, lewis began throwing furniture at her. his wife and children eventually jumped in and attempted to stop the woman. the intruder didn't stop until one of the children, the lewis' 12-year-old son logan, shoved a wrench into her neck.         police arrested the intruder and she is being treated and evaluated at the hospital. the lewis family left with bruises and bite marks.      "i'm scared to go in there, i won't even go into any room by myself, i'm terrified," m. lewis said.      detectives told the family that the suspect lives nearby and will eventually be charged robbery, breaking and entering and attempted murder. she is currently in the icu with severe head trauma.

Neutral	a lot of the horribleness going on right now, both internally in the individual and on the external micro and macro levels, fit the prohecies about the kali yuga very well: [URL]      i don't remember the textual basis for the specific explanations about the history of the gradual decline of the human form found in buddhism.      i obviously don't know from direct personal experience or empiricism that the following is correct, but now i feel like digging more.      the teachings i received on that topic states (iirc) that we've gone through what we might call a gradual grossification.      in the distant past humans didn't possess solid bodies, but were "light beings," living thousands of years.      at a later stage in the process of degradation, humans were giants, still with a life-span many times that which we're used to now.      it's kinda interesting in that context, that we've been finding skeletons of giants here and there.      we've slowly declined since then. we become more easily diseased, we increasingly ignore the suffering of our fellow beings, we have a very hard time questioning our persistent illusion (as einstein called it) of dualism and physicalism (which i think lay at the basis of our ethical decline), and it's getting worse.      according to the buddhist master i heard talk about it, the pollution of our environment is one mechanism by which the degradation will continue to worsen, until we reach the point where we're literal gnomes living no more than 10 years.      our ethical and spiritual virtues, our true nature of boundless wisdom and kindness, will be increasingly inaccessible to us, velied behind thickening layers of delusion and ignorance.      it is said that when the dharma (a complex word, but in this case it refers to the teachings that lead to liberation) is completely gone from the world and forgotten by men, we will have reached the end of the kali yuga, after which the fourth buddha, maitreya (who is, curiously, unlike most buddhas, always portrayed sitting on a chair) will appear.      interestingly, maitraya will teach only the basic vehicle of liberation, known as the theravada/hinayana ("way of the elders" or something like that, and "small vehicle" respectively), whereas the current buddha, shakyamuni, who appeared 2500 years ago, also taught the mahayana (great vehicle), the vajrayana (diamond or thunderbolt vehicle), mantrayana, mahamudra and dzogchen. [edit: the latter four classes of teachings mentioned were in most cases not given through what could be called conventional means and not necessarily during the life time of the buddha. adherents of the theravada/hinayana schools will tell you that only the pali canon truly came from buddha. conversely, the higher schools will always include the teachings of the theravada/hinayana, which are a prequisite, beginning  with the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path.)      the reason for that, is that the buddha knew about the kali yuga: how full of disturbing emotions we'd become, and how much suffering we would experience.      the mahayana is the path of the bodhisattva, and along with the hinayana it's prequisite for the practice of the higher vehicles, such as  vajrayana, which is the vehicle of transformation.      knowing we would have a lot of disturbing emotions and suffering, providing the teachings that allow for the transformation of that into fuel on the path to liberation, was important.      there's so much to say about this and so many interesting little nuggest to be found in the wisdom traditions of the east.      again, i don't know any of this to be true, and my basis for the above is almost completely an appeal to authority.      i'm going to delve more into the topic. i'll probably post the write-up on r/psychonaut rather than here though :)      edit: spelling + a few details.

Neutral	yes you're kinda dumb. jesus how much evil does someone need to do to you before you take a stand. she betrayed your trust, broke her vows, tells you about this years after the kids are born so she's been able to milk you for support. now in a divorce you have child support and been together long enough for alimony. cheating isn't a mistake, it's a long series of choices that do irreparable damage. she did not care about you at all then, and she continued the lie each day she didn't tell you, robbing you of the opportunity to leave before conceiving a child and finding another more suitable  partner.      now you're older, have a kid, and she tells you since leaving would suck just as much as staying a blowing this off as just some mistake she made years ago.
Neutral	i think its a fascinating phenomenon, the disconnect between what many women are convinced they should want in a man (in this case, an emasculated nice guy), vs what they actually do want. also, how i can believe that i should only want to eat vegetables and lean proteins, but that doesn't change my body's cravings for sugary foods. i just think that its funny how people can form ideologies against their own natures.

"i believe it is an established maxim in morals that he who makes an assertion without knowing whether it is true or false, is guilty of falsehood; and the accidental truth of the assertion, does not justify or excuse him."   abraham lincoln.      don't look now but republican "honest" abe lincoln just called you a fuckin liar.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	no, not until you learn some manners.  offence is not given it is taken, and your refusal to take responsibility for understanding the effect of your words on your victims, or that your victims *are* victims, is part of the problem.        the hyperpolarisation the us is leading the world into has turned white and male fragilities into weapons, to be polished and oiled and caressed lovingly.   there is an ecosystem of businesses built on exploiting white and male fragilities, pandering and nourishing them.   there is huge grassroots support, countless volunteers doing the thankless work of rage-reading liberal sites and responding.     *somebody* has to not-buy all those gillette razor blades, and these are the people who do it.        it is going to get a lot worse imo.  can israel vs palestine be implemented inside the us?  why not?        liberals' smug myopia is one of the reasons trumpism has arisen and continues to conquer the us, sweeping all before it.   i'm picking a second term of trump, with a handover to pence so he can abuse the presidential pardon to get / keep the crew out of jail.     but pardoning requires charging, and i think trump knows where to find dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to pence.        tl;dr     you know that sjw cartoon of "i'm not racist but ..." where the friend covers their mouth with a mittened hand, and says "shush, nothing good ever comes after that"?      whenever you catch yourself wanting to write "white people" or "white males", just shush yourself.  never mind your theories about what you think you are trying to say.  your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the us are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.  you can call them stupid neanderthals but they out-manoevered your side and have stacked the federal courts and  supreme court for a few decades.  if trump were impeached tomorrow they still would be winning. for decades.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	all i'm getting is that the two organizations are christian orgs, and chick-fil-a is owned by christians. call me cynical, but i feel like the anti-lgbt aspects aren't the focus of the groups, or the donations.      also, going off that same logic, isn't islam an anti-lgbt organization? why is islam touted so much by leftists if they are also super pro-lgbt?
Neutral	not sure of the protocol for responding to something like this, but get therapy if possible. that's not condescending but rather coming from someone who had success with it.       and it takes time to get over relationships. give yourself a break. be nicer to yourself. you wouldn't talk to a friend the way you talk to yourself.

Neutral	the massacre at columbine high school took place on april 20, 1999. astonishingly, for eight days after the tragedy, during thousands of hours of prime-time television coverage, virtually no one mentioned the word "drugs." then the issue was opened. eric harris, one of the shooters at columbine, was on at least one drug.      the ny times of april 29, 1999, and other papers reported that harris was rejected from enlisting in the marines for medical reasons. a friend of the family told the times that harris was being treated by a psychiatrist. and then several sources told the washington post that the drug prescribed as treatment was luvox, manufactured by solvay.      in two more days, the "drug-issue" was gone.      luvox is of the same class as prozac and zoloft and paxil. they are labeled ssris (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). they attempt to alleviate depression by changing brain-levels of the natural substance serotonin. luvox has a slightly different chemical configuration from prozac, paxil, and zoloft, and it was approved by the fda for obsessive-compulsive disorder, although many doctors apparently prescribe it for depression.      prozac is the wildly popular eli lilly antidepressant which has been linked to suicidal and homicidal actions. it is now given to young children. again, its chemical composition is very close to luvox, the drug that harris took.      dr. peter breggin, the eminent psychiatrist and author (toxic psychiatry, talking back to prozac, talking back to ritalin), told me, "with luvox there is some evidence of a four-percent rate for mania in adolescents. mania, for certain individuals, could be a component in grandiose plans to destroy large numbers of other people. mania can go over the hill to psychosis."      dr. joseph tarantolo is a psychiatrist in private practice in washington dc. he is the president of the washington chapter of the american society of psychoanalytic physicians. tarantolo states that "all the ssris [including prozac and luvox] relieve the patient of feeling. he becomes less empathic, as in `i don't care as much,' which means `it's easier for me to harm you.' if a doctor treats someone who needs a great deal of strength just to think straight, and gives him one of these drugs, that could push him over the edge into violent behavior."      in arianna huffington's syndicated newspaper column of july 9, 1998, dr. breggin states, "i have no doubt that prozac can cause or contribute to violence and suicide. i've seen many cases. in a recent clinical trial, 6 percent of the children became psychotic on prozac. and manic psychosis can lead to violence."      a study from the september 1989 journal of clinical psychiatry, by joseph lipiniski, jr., indicates that in five examined cases people on prozac developed what is called akathesia. symptoms include intense anxiety, inability to sleep, the "jerking of extremities," and "bicycling in bed or just turning around and around." dr. breggin comments that akathesia "may also contribute to the drug's tendency to cause self-destructive or violent tendencies ... akathesia can become the equivalent of biochemical torture and could possibly tip someone over the edge into self-destructive or violent behavior ... the june 1990 health newsletter, produced by the public citizen research group, reports, 'akathesia, or symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, and purposeless movements of the feet and legs, may occur in 10-25 percent of patients on prozac.'"      other studies:      "emergence of self-destructive phenomena in children and adolescents during fluoxetine [prozac] treatment," published in the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry (1991, vol.30), written by ra king, ra riddle, et al. it reports self-destructive phenomena in 14% (6/42) of children and adolescents (10-17 years old) who had treatment with fluoxetine (prozac) for obsessive-compulsive disorder.      july, 1991. journal of child and adolescent psychiatry. hisako koizumi, md, describes a thirteen-year-old boy who was on prozac: "full of energy," "hyperactive," "clown-like." all this devolved into sudden violent actions which were "totally unlike him."      september, 1991. the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry. author laurence jerome reports the case of a ten-year old who moves with his family to a new location. becoming depressed, the boy is put on prozac by a doctor. the boy is then "hyperactive, agitated ... irritable." he makes a "somewhat grandiose assessment of his own abilities." then he calls a stranger on the phone and says he is going to kill him. the prozac is stopped, and the symptoms disappear.      the well-known goodman and gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics reveals a strange fact. it states that ritalin [given for adhd] is "structurally related to amphetamines ... its pharmacological properties are essentially the same as those of the amphetamines." in other words, the only clear difference is legality. and the effects, in layman's terms, are obvious. you take speed and, sooner or later, you start crashing. you become agitated, irritable, paranoid, delusional, aggressive.      in his book, toxic psychiatry, dr. breggin discusses the subject of drug combinations: "combining antidepressants [e.g., prozac, luvox, paxil] and psychostimulants [e.g., ritalin] increases the risk of cardiovascular catastrophe, seizures, sedation, euphoria, and psychosis. withdrawal from the combination can cause a severe reaction that includes confusion, emotional instability, agitation, and aggression." children are frequently medicated with this combination, and when we highlight such effects as aggression, psychosis, and emotional instability, it is obvious that the result is pointing toward the very real possibility of violence.      in 1986, the international journal of the addictions published a most important literature review by richard scarnati. it was titled, "an outline of hazardous side effects of ritalin (methylphenidate)" [v.21(7), pp. 837-841].      scarnati listed over a hundred adverse affects of ritalin and indexed published journal articles for each of these symptoms.

Neutral	u/search was a mod on this sub for a brief period starting around february, just as the smollett hoax began. he made a strange decision to enforce the "confirmed hoax" rule, which quickly became an excuse to remove any posts related to the developing hoax. some suspect he was effectively a pr agent who forced his way onto the mod team, and his actions have definitely split the userbase.      he has been sacked, however, so there's a high chance the sub will recover.

Slur	i mean, in a way women are allowed and expected to show emotion but simultaneously people use those emotions to point out how irrational and weak women are. hysteria was used as a way to turn female emotions into a pathology not that long ago and still today people say a female can't be good leaders because their emotions get in the way of decision making and some shit about pms.         at the same time, if women in position of power don't show much emotions and feminine traits, people acuse them of being "too harsh", "too manly" or simply put, a bitch.            women are taught to show emotion and are shamed for it, men are taught to not show emotion and get rewarded for it. yes it is at the cost of their own mental health and that is what the toxic form of masculinity is, but it doesn't mean women have much better.

Neutral	i would say honest abe lincoln would have more problems with an open-ended investigation that was based on a false report (the steele dossier).  a defense of the republic requires us to be vigilant of any overreach of government power, and the power of a prosecutor with a blank check to investigate anything is among the most dangerous power there is.      then there's the fact that as you pointed out so many leaks during the mueller investigation.  does anyone seriously believe that if the investigation uncovered a "smoking gun" evidence that it won't be leaked and end up on the front page of the nyt the very next day?  the fact no such event happened strongly suggests that mueller tried for nearly 2 years but couldn't find any crime to tie to trump.

Neutral	i have scoliosis(a curve to either side in the straight line of my back), lordosis(the curve in the lower s of my back is too big), and kyphosis(the curve in the upper s of my back is too big). so, literally every way your spine can be messed up, it is. it causes me pain every single day. had i gotten a brace it would have been fine. then, my knees are very messed up. long story short, at 13 they had a quack do a surgery on my left knee and he botched it. it pops with every step and is just in general wrong. he's since lost his license to practice because of other cases. because my left knee is messed up, i've compensated with my right for 21 years. now my right is arthritic and i'm only 34. both of these things didn't have to be this way. we had top tier insurance. we had money. but, my mom was an alcoholic and my dad only provided financially. he was never home. my mom made either bad decisions about my health or *no* decisions about it.  by the time i could take care of my own health it was too late. so, i suffer in pain every day, and as i get older it only gets worse, and it didn't have to be this way.      edit: word

Neutral	its not because of corrupt governments (okay some of it is) but the vast vast vast majority of the problem is that the people trying to help do not understand economics.      we ship food, we ship mosquito nets and medicine to these poor places. but how do the locals compete with a product that is free? if i want to manufacture mosquito nets and sell them, who will buy my product when they are being given out for free? if i'm a farmer, how do i sell my crop, when the market is being flooded with free food? we are putting locals out of business. we are creating welfare dependents and then, most insidiously, we change the amount being given year by year. we destroy industries and then cut aid a few years later leaving people to starve and die of malaria.      if we wanted to actually help, we would build industries in those places and create jobs so that they can support themselves instead of being reliant on aid. if anyone who reads this wants to help poorer countries, [URL] groups together microloans for 3rd world countries. it helps far more than throwing free goods and services at them, and the majority of loans are repaid so your donation (loan) is very likely to get returned to you so you can loan it again.

Neutral	they *were* anti-communist, but you have to bear in mind thay "communism" to them referred to a very narrow political movement at the time, and it was an **entirely** leninist one.  other communists rarely adopt the capital-c communist label since mls (or mlms) always get to it first.      in any case though, he's explained that he doesn't go after communists for the same reason he doesn't go after monarchists.  they're completely irrelevant.

Neutral	hi!   maybe around a year ago (or two), i followed this subreddit called something like "true", "real" or "proven conspiracies" and they were all posts linked to big media /press articles proving stuff from monsanto to whatnot. where is it now? did it change its name? or is it down?   cheers
Neutral	btw, the post is still up. they didnt remove it.

Neutral	so which rule did he violate internet people:      if you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action.      rule 0: be civil   let's keep the talk and discussion on what ever the subject matter of the post may be. resorting to personal quarrels and arguments that may use insults and other tribal-like behaviors will be deleted. keep it civil.      rule 1: correct formatting   the requirements for posting to this subreddit is to have a self contained opinion within the title. the text will be used to expand and elaborate on why you think/feel this way. you may also include why you think this is an unpopular or controversial opinion.      rule 2: opinion must be unpopular/controversial   this sub isn't just opinions, but unpopular and/or controversial ones. if your opinion has been posted to the subreddit recently, chances are it'll get removed. so please search before submitting.      rule 3: no reposts/search before submitting   if essentially the same opinion gets reposted it'll automatically mean it's not an unpopular opinion (within the context of the sub). it will get removed. if your opinion is about a ongoing event, there will usually be a mega thread where you can discuss there.      rule 4: no spam   new accounts are subject to a 24 hour waiting period before posting. spamming will usually result to a perma ban.      rule 5: no trolling   trolling is saying random unsolicited things that only serve to invoke a knee jerk reaction. trolls will usually get permanently banned.      rule 6: elaborate   an important rule in this subreddit is that all opinions must be elaborated on. there is a discussion to be had, so please expand on what you have said.   your post must contain more than 160 characters (roughly two or three standard sentences) to avoid auto-deletion by automod.      rule 7: hate posts are not allowed   opinion can be unpopular unless it's blatantly a hateful post. hostile, rude and aggressive behavior is not a necessity to express your opinion. please be civil and and have respect. bear in mind that justifying or endorsing pedophilia activities (sidenote: discussion on treatments of the mental health itself is fine), rape, race issues, assault or other similar crimes will usually count as hate speech. this does not mean you'll get banned for saying one crime is not as severe as another or saying you can understand why someone would commit a crime. race baiting is a ban-able offence      rule 8: no low effort/satire posts   any opinion that is not thought out well or posts that clearly have very little effort put into them will be removed. this also includes commonly posted opinions to the subreddit. please note that obscure topics and meta commentaries on the subreddit do not constitute a valid unpopular opinion post."

'course, it's way too late for that now. i found her cold little body, nestled between the other kittens in their bed. gosh, she was so so cold. i buried her in my backyard that morning. another dead cat to add to the list.             i'm sorry wendigo.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	no, it is factually true. if you don't have dysphoria, that means you're comfortable with your genitals, meaning you aren't trans.      > in reference to genders? unknown. as gender is a psychological way of thinking there is theoretically countless genders.      gender is "how comfortable you are with your genitals". if you have a penis and are ok with it, you're a man, if not, you're a transwoman, and the same for vaginas.      don't confuse "gender roles" with "gender". being a man doesn't preclude you from wearing dresses and being a woman doesn't preclude you from working as a trucker.      > in reference to biological sex? a confirmed minimum of 4. as sex is a physical characteristic, at the moment we can confirm 4 different sex characteristics (penis, vagina, both p & v or neither) but this could change in the future.      there's no biological basis for this. anomalies are exactly that, anomalies, they do not form part of the characteristics of the species, and humans are a sexual species, meaning two sexes.      > with all of this gender/sex/sexuality discussions we need to remember that it's a change field of research and if my years of sexology education and research has told me anything, it's that everything we know is changing and we're finding out more and more about human sexuality every single day.      humans aren't special, we're exactly like almost every other mammal as far as sex comes.

PersonDirectedAbuse	obama was a reactionary mistake and a distraction, i'm glad that trump won so that the system could be laid bear and make it obvious that there is no solution besides the abolition of the united states.
Neutral	this reminds me of a question on a pew survey that i took much issue with. the survey was trying to quantify how much or how little people could spot opinion in the news.       the question was along the lines of "there is a serious problem with illegal immigration in the us."  the expected answer was that this was opinion, not fact. however, there undeniably is a serious problem with illegal immigration in the us. no matter where you fall in immigration, whether it be open borders or no immigration or somewhere in between, we fundamentally do not agree to a solution in the us. thus it is a serious problem.       this is relevant to the op because pew is supposed to be a serious research group and are supposed to minimize bias and uncover the "correct" way of thinking, but even they tell you how to think.

Neutral	i ride a bike.  i always wear a helmet though my state does not require it.      the reality is that a helmet will protect from low-level injuries.       people who advocate for choice about helmet laws may just be resigned to the idea that wrecking on a bike will probably kill you anyway.      that's sad, but i can see how my dad for instance has seen enough death to know that most of those wouldn't be prevented by helmets.  a sorta bleak resignation that most fatal accidents won't be helped by helmets.      i feel like "let's not add to those numbers by going helmetless and dying in less extreme cases".     
Neutral	like for real?

Neutral	are they trying to say that these are the only things they think straight people draw? in fucking lost.
Neutral	men are much more shamed in media for doing 'girly' things than when girls do 'manly' things. (wife-fu tv trope ring a bell?)   our male-guided society simply considers masculine preferable to feminine. again, this is very general, and i'm not like implying that trans men have a walk in the park or anything, but they do get a fraction of ridicule and negative attention that trans women get, and i think there's a reason for that. but that's another can of worms
Neutral	at no point was there any off topic discussion and all top level replies were attempts to answer the question.      my guess? "religion bad lmao"

Neutral	they've always hidden their agenda under excuses like 'its just jokes!' or pretending its ironic, or saying that they are doing it to get a rise out of people.         they deliberately act like they are just messing around, so anyone who tries to call them out looks like they are "feeding the trolls" or "taking the bait" or whatever.         this has always been what 4chan is.
Neutral	today wasn't terrible.  i suppose that would hinge on your definition of terrible.  at any rate, i happened upon an article.  ronda rousey is helping set up a suicide prevention center or something.  something like that.  as i read through the article, i came to learn that her father and grandfather committed suicide.      i appreciate the kind thought and i don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going.      how stupid do you think i am?  do you think i don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  do you think that i'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'?      it's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, i don't take too kindly to being told that i don't have the right to commit suicide.  i don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when i am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide.      why is it that when i get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is "get help."?  what do you think this help is going to give me that i haven't already experienced?  it'll give me more goddamn bills and i'll get somebody on the phone asking me if i want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy.      i know how to fight this.  the reason that i'm sitting here typing this is all the proof i need.      when i see these anti-suicide things, i just feel so irked.  the only time you give a fuck about me is when i'm in a suicidal mindset.  beside that, i'm just a blank face.  a mere statistic.      believe me.  seriously.  believe me.  i'm not yanking your chain.  i know how bad suicide is.  you don't need to remind me of that.      i can't stop you from trying to prevent suicide, but i can state my opinion and so, i have.

Neutral	the problem is that the ev for theft in california is now positive.  a decent shoplifter can expect to be caught one time in one hundred or less.  if you can steal 100 items woth $50 and face only a small fine the one time you get caught then stealing becomes a very profitable business.      all theft should be criminal.  people who are caught committing multiple thefts have shown that they're unable to be productive members of society and should be punished much, much more severely.  i would suggest that the first time a person is caught stealing they should be given a fine ~ doublethevalue of what they stole, and a warningnot to repeat their actions.  the second time they get caught they have proven themselves unable to behave within society, and they should automatically receive a long sentence of hard labor.

Neutral	it's pretty backwards. even other sites tend to respond even if they won't reverse anything.
Neutral	>i really wish we could get to the genesis of the hatred of bigger people.      as with all societal trends it's complicated but i think media plays the most significant role.       movies, tv, advertising... everyone looks a certain way. even non visual mediums like books and radio will *describe* people as having these certain looks.  and heck, you can see this even in how very body-positive overweight people dress/do their makeup.... they're still copying all the styles popularized by people of a more normal weight.       i don't think that makes the body positive overweight people hypocrites though, which people will want to do... instead i think it just shows how unbelievably pervasive media and societal perceptions of beauty really are. even a person claiming to be body positive will have makeup that mimics what you might see on a celebrity.       there is an element of health involved. no doubt, being overweight is generally less healthy... obesity is not the way the human body naturally should end up... but i think that's so buried beneath the cultural elements that i find it generally hard to believe most people when they claim their fat people hate comes from beliefs about health and wellness.          >the average size of americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people i cant wrap my head around.      so i actually have noticed less hatred for fat people in the past 5 years or so, perhaps owing to the increasing size of americans. at this moment, some 2/3rds of americans are overweight or obese.       however, there's also an element one commenter pointed out that is clearly on display in this aita post: self-hate/self-loathing... the overweight girl very likely is quite ashamed and sensitive about her size and is using the sassy, in-your-face body positivity as a cover... and i'm sure that many of the people shitting on fat people online are themselves overweight.           >mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course.      absolutely. especially i think in the sort of middle-range of being bigger... if you're slightly overweight as a guy, it's much more acceptable than being slightly overweight as a girl.

Neutral	i think i understand what theyre saying. but it shows just how hateful and ignorant they are.      what they mean by "everyone is sad and lonely and this company has been telling them what they want to hear for the last 20 years" is that the games, and franchise as a whole, teach that friendship and companionship are important and help you achieve great things that wouldve been impossible for you to do on your own.      in red ans blue, we're told the reason we keep beating blue is because we treat our pokemon as our friends, while hes only concerned with having the strongest team. he looses because his pokemon dont actually care aboit him because he doesnt show them kindness, while our pokemon go above and beyond because they genuinely dont want to let us down - this is a theme continued in nearly every game in the franchise.         now, heres the sad part. they say this is "the same way the alt right recruits incels" which is partially true.   kind of. theres a grain of truth in it in that its easy to radicalize groups that have been oppressed, mistreated, etc. this is the same basic recruiting tactic that isis uses; they find vulnerable people and promise them that they can be apart of something bigger, something greater, somewhere that they can finally belong. - cults have also been known to use this tactic.      but, instead of looking at that and going "maybe we should treat people better, show them basic human kindness and respect. let them know theyre valued as a person even if they disagree with me" they miss the point and go "pikachu must be a nhazi!!! thats the only possible conclusion!!!"

Neutral	while it is going away, i find people still appreciate it. some old aunt might act offended if you don't send her a thank you card. forget her. if you are sending a card because it is expected of you, then you are sending it for the wrong reason anyway.              on the other hand. when someone gives you a gift and you say thank you in person, you now have the opportunity to double down on a good thing.  almost all mail you get is trash these days, so it's nice when something isn't.             >hi, grandma,     >     >it was great seeing you at the baby shower last week. with the baby on the way i know my life is about to get much more hectic and it was so nice to get to see you before i loose any chance at sleep, hahaha. thank  you so much for the crib i was afraid i would have to keep the baby in a shoe box but this will be so much better. i can't wait until the next time i see you and i hope all is well.     >     >love,     >     >batman      it takes very little time to write one of these and the person who receives it will likely appreciate hearing from you, especially if they are older.  you don't even need to go all out on special cards from hallmark or some shit. regular paper is no less sentimental, which is the whole point.              i'm certainly not saying you should do it. but you might consider looking at it as something you can do that someone who gave you a gift will enjoy, instead of something you *have* to do because your parents or whoever said so.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i've been pondering a theory that tptb will eventually get rid of the monetary system all together and transition us to a social credit/debt system and our wealth/luxury of our life will be dictated by our social score.  the ideas are all around us at the moment, over in china they are beta testing the physical system of tracking and scoring, you have 5g which will be the platform for it to run on globally,  and then you have the social debt ideas being pushed by climate change.  over in europe they are talking about how when you are born, you are born with eco debt already and will need to work that off.  i could see a system where the plebs are born with eco debt and need to work that off, while also complying to the social norms and conditions set forth by the social credit system.        just an idea i've been kicking around in my head recently.

Neutral	osrs was a mistake. they gave the whiniest subsection of runescape their own game and now they screech endlessly over *everything*.      i remember in 2017 the lgbt pride event. you gathered rainbow pieces and got a scarf cosmetic. this resulted in thinly veiled homophobia. it was hidden behind "the update wasn't polled", which was subsequently crushed by the chants of "we pay, no gay".      tl;dr osrs community is toxic as fuck and this drama is gonna be good.
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i have a dark sense of humour. i never really make jokes about gays, though.       i mean, i'm sure i've made a joke aimed at a gay man before, but the focus of the humour wasn't in any way related to his sexuality.      my jokes mostly rely on dead baby humour, being a serial killer, or cannibalism (though i hate that word. i prefer to think of myself as a humanitarian). it's not about killing gays, or hating *anyone,* it's about being hungry.      the only group i specifically target is vegetarians and vegans, because they eat what food eats, therefore by the transitive property, they are food. that's not hate, that's just math.

Neutral	i am 38.  i've suffered from depression since i was a young kid.  it is tough for me to find happiness, and especially hard to get motivated most of the time.  i have been through some very, very, tough times in my life, and that doesn't help.  i was on meds from around 18 years old until 4 years ago.  i cut that ball and chain by eating a very clean diet, exercise, meditation, and self help therapy.        my best advice to you is to find something(s) that makes you happy (i know its tough).  for me, music, my guitar, my pets, and reading are what bring joy to me.  maybe try to pick up a new hobby?      hang in there.  you are not alone.  i have learned the hard way that i (you) am the only one that can bring happiness and meaning into my life.        always here to lend an ear if you need to talk.        namaste

Neutral	the most important argument i emphasize is that sanders is a political candidate just like everyone else.      it's crazy how so many americans (particularly young voters) thought and still think he's some sort of pure newcomer that doesn't have the problems that other presidential candidates do. they say he's not corrupt, represents the working class, truly connects to people, and would bring sweeping changes such as large taxes on the one percent and free college.       in reality, sanders is irresponsible, lacks the pragmatic ability to put ideas into practice, and has remained grossly over-simplistic on the economy, race, international affairs, and other issues. his personal history speaks volumes to his ineptitude as a candidate. in particular, his lack of significant work to show his commitment to politics and the country.       his actions are self-centered (e.g., continuing to campaign when he had no chance of winning and continuing internal strife within the democratic party, etc.), immature (e.g., as though every thing that happened in the country was primarily some sort of rigged, systematic injustice carried out by elitist individuals who control everything. and, seriously, "feel the bern?" is your campaign slogan? not to mention all the ridiculous memes portraying him this way. because everyone knows memes are well-justified, valid arguments about knowledge.), and in many ways more dangerous than trump's actions, in my opinion. and he's a socialist. i'm not voting for a socialist.      the primary reason why he didn't face much opposition was because the republican party and republican citizens generally wanted to stir conflict between sanders and clinton (so they didn't want to give clinton ammo), and that they would save much of their attack for the general election against clinton herself.

Neutral	i do understand that i have a whole life ahead of me, and i'm grateful for that. but it's just i can't just stop contemplating death. trust me i've tried that. the only thing that's stops me from thinking about it is when i'm with my friends.
Neutral	also, don't forget, fema are the bad guys.       seriously, the game is a right wing conspiracy theorist's wet dream
Neutral	enjoy the credit
Neutral	really, "believe all victims" needs to come with an asterisk after "believe". i agree that you shouldn't respond to accusations with a knee-jerk "you're a liar", you should offer sympathy and should lean towards believing them, since the vast majority of accusations (98% of all crimes and 91% of sexual crimes, according to the fbi iirc) are true. what you should also do is weigh all the evidence as it is made known and if the evidence suggests that the crime was faked or the accusation is false to call that out as soon as is reasonable.      trust, but verify.

Neutral	my grandparents are from china they've given me the story multiple times and i still don't understand
Neutral	i wouldn't know, because i've yet to see anything on ep that's even remotely readable. it's all like three sentence stories fluffed up into the most long-winded nonsense imaginable.            ~~"a kid wanted a milkshake and the mum lost her shit when i said the machine was broken"~~ "it was a warm but breezy morning on the northwest coast. the cicadas, buzzing in the sun's warm glow, signaled that it was once again the season of adventure, irreverence and youthful optimism..."
Neutral	taking drugs to work harder is an excuse addicts use.
Neutral	i know. i'm just tip toeing rule 2
Neutral	what i'm saying is that they don't do anything different really. there are so many reasons people are celibate. i don't see why choosing to be celibate specifically as sexuality puts you under the same umbrella as a group of people who have been persecuted for their sexual choices. i don't see the relation, i don't see why they need to be includded in that umbrella when they weren't part of that expereince. i'm not saying it's not a valid thing, if you don't want anything to do with sex that's cool, but i don't see what that has to do with the pride movement.
Neutral	for the record, not all atheists are douchebags. seems like you found one. he may well have plenty to sort, but facts are what's left at the end of the day.      also, i understand that because of your upbringing having someone "take your virginity" can be a big deal, but know that just because you had sex with someone it doesn't make you less worthy. the emotional turmoil is strong, i'm well aware, but not being a virgin anymore doesn't make you a slut or whatever.      to me the emotional side of the story far, far outweighs the physiological slight change. a hymen maketh not the good woman.      rape victims aren't debauched people. you've been abused, deceived, to me you're in a situation closer to having been raped than just dumped. do not let this experience define you.      i suggest you read about the psychology of the raped person, you *weren't* raped but i think you may find info not completely irrelevant to what you're going through atm.       you take care girl, you'll be fine. keep on going in your philosophical path, to me it's fine if you remain a believer as long as that doesn't make you hurt others or yourself. but don't go around thinking you owe your family or a future bf / husband to remain a christian, a virgin etc. you do you.       peace prevails.
Neutral	you're not a pirate. there is no romanticized position to take here. you're a selfish asshole who looks for any excuse to steal shit. accept it.
Neutral	no, at the time.  he didn't come across with another date until he found someone he thought was interested in him.  she did wrong but he also did when he made arrangements with her knowing she was the backup in case he didn't find someone better.  they both wanted what they wanted and were unwilling to possibly do without in order to treat another person kindly.      he could have said that their arrangements to go together were contingent on whether he found a person that was dating material to go with him.  that's fine.   you have to think that some women are told guys are just going to use them for sex, so finding out a guy doesn't want to do something friendly together when he doesn't think he will score bugs some women.  like being friend zoned does for men.        they both did wrong, but i think she was the one with the most responsibility because she shouldn't have accepted the offer if she didn't want to date him.

PersonDirectedAbuse	fuck off.      edit: ah, never mind, you are fine here. i didn't realize what sub i was in. have fun!
Neutral	i've had numerous posts removed from r/politics now, usually ones simply espousing left wing (by which i mean actually-left-wing, not "vote blue no matter who" liberalism) and/or anti imperialist viewpoints. most in that sub have been reinstated, but the mods refuse to tell me why my comments were deleted. allegedly it was "false positives" picked up by their bot, and telling me why my comments got picked up will "let bad actors defeat the bot."      this isn't just limited to r/politics, though. i've had dozens of comments removed now from various subreddits. the most recent was a response to the question "what's wrong with being a landlord," which broke no rules and yet was shadow deleted a few hours later (implying to me that it was a manual deletion, not a bot).       i think this is all so fucked up. if you disagree with me, downvote me, argue with me, don't arbitrarily remove my responses.      if my comment breaks rules, delete it and inform me of the rule violation, don't just insidiously delete it for everyone *but* me without me even being aware of the fact or the reason why.       i'm getting increasingly angry over all of this. there's literally no recourse except to pm the mods and hope for an answer, but if they don't want to reinstate your comment then fuck you. it's absurd.       just wanted to let everyone know that this is sop on reddit right now, so if you've ever chimed in on a discussion only to have 0 upvotes, downvotes, or comments- check to see if you've been shadow censored.
Neutral	most certainly.

Neutral	so people who feel that something is *off*, post here in order to check if they are not alone in thinking this way. i'm fine with that. as you said, it's part of the process.

Slur	because the kids (including the 16 y/o) don't understand what they're talking about, it was clearly orchestrated by the adults (presumably parents) who are just using their kids as tools to make the senator look bad.      diane is trying to explain her side & they keep interrupting her, naturally she says "well you know better than i do" facetiously and suddenly people are *literally* calling her a "bitch". no, the lady who won't let a senator much older and wiser than herself speak is the bitch. diane only resorts to saying this shit because nobody will let her talk, and it's very clear if you watched the video.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	similar here, i was raised in a big family except i was the youngest.  nothing about it makes me want to have children.  i understand that some people had terrific family lives where their parents taught them all kinds of interpersonal skills and were nurturing, etc... but that was far from my experience and i don't have those things internalized to pass on.  i've gotten very good with my cat though, as a middle aged man and i'm nurturing to her, but she's far less demanding than a child or children and i can afford her much more easily.        i dated a lot previously and grew a lot as a person and had some peak experiences but had a lot of bad experiences with women who had hidden agendas, issues with dishonesty, cheating, gaslighting, etc... so i gave it up and now focus on my job, friends and hobbies and i'm more consistently  happy than i've ever been in my life overall.

Neutral	this is fucking sweet.
Neutral	this is mostly just for my peace of mind but here goes.      a few years ago i met a girl, we'll call her margo, who was amazing in a million ways.  she was musical, beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent, and she was not my wife.        while my marriage was on the rocks at the time, and my wife wasn't around very much, we were still married.  it was a very dark time for me, but margo was like a massive light that enveloped me and reminded me of who i was.      i think it's worth mentioning that margo and i never slept together, however we absolutely developed real, and deep feelings for each other.      anyway, eventually my wife finds out i've been connecting with margo, and is (rightfully) furious.  there were a few tear filled nights, and some very hard conversations, but in the end, we decided to work things out.  i unceremoniously, (and with much difficulty and hesitation) ended contact with margo.  i still feel horrible about how this all happened because she really was an amazing person who didn't deserve any of the drama i brought upon her.      so, my wife and i work things out, and things are better than they've ever been between us.  we re-found the love we had somehow lost, and are stronger because of everything that happened.  that being said, there was still always a part of me that was just.... empty and regretful.  not because of how things turned out but because of the way they happened.  i was also worried about margo, because for a long time i was her sounding board, and now, i couldn't help her.      tonight i randomly decided to google margo, and there was a video of her singing a brand new song, and parts of it were too specific to not be about what happened between us, but it gave me closure that everything is alright now.      it's late and i'm tired but happy. even though this is a throwaway account i'm hoping this post just gets buried in the "new" pile. this was more for me than anything, because i don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff, and posting it here feels like talking about it.  if you read this far, congratulations determined reader.      tl;dr   not really interesting.

Neutral	i don't think i agree. by the end of the movie, alita has failed to save her boyfriend, failed to rally the hunters, arguably got ido's ex worse-than-killed, and i don't think she remembers her entire past yet. she's barely gotten *remotely* close to nova. it's pretty clear they're setting up for a sequel.      alita only starts off being amazing at things which involve combat. in the bar scene, she's posturing. she's *imitating* the actual hunters, or at least what she thinks they're like. or at the very least, she's trying to shift the problem onto her fallback solution; busting heads. if she was a mary sue, the rousing speech would've actually *worked*.
Neutral	imagine being this brainwashed and gullible to leftwing propaganda.
Neutral	as far as i'm aware, left-wing smuggies aren't banned here. this place has really served as a rebuttal to conquest's second law, though.
Neutral	lol ok bud.
Neutral	(this isn't against you.) fuck, i hate how preachy some sides of the fandom are about grrm's pace of writing. this, right now, is the longest the series has gone without a new book (no, the side projects don't fucking count thanks), and i don't care how ghoulish it makes me to complain about it. mention anything about the very real risk of grrm kicking the bucket because he's an obese 60-something male and it's "you aren't entitled to anything!!!!!".      i complain about that *and* hate the show too because i like to have my cake of pure hatred and eat it too.

Neutral	>sounds like coastal nc too. i feel your pain mate... -13 points      i get being annoyed at americans for saying they have it worse, but downvoting people just for sympathising, ableit ignorantly, seems defensive to me.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	because only those poor, uneducated people of colour are addicted to the crack. and it's all the whie patriarchy's fault because those poor, unassuming people of colour don't know any better, and need super enlightened protection from us good guys to function.      until some crackhead steals their tv.

Neutral	this is exactly what digg was like. it was whoever the power user there was (it's been so long) that had like half the front page there. site went dead for being too corporate. hopefully reddit also dies but probably won't. back then, digg was only able to appeal to nerds. so nerds wised up and left en-mass. now that reddit is basically buzzfeed, that isn't a problem and this site will probably be riddled with ad-ware and rip-off products in a few years.

Neutral	that doesn't give people to right to act like asshats, and to also disregard and deny that sometimes people who do believe they are 100% homosexual (and this applies vice-versa as well...) can end up with feelings for the opposite sex. it seems pretty close-minded to deny that this happens. i've even seen people get ridiculed over this notion by other lgbt+ members.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	people who grew up in predominantly black "ghettos" have a certain dialect and vocabulary. they suppress this when talking to people outside the "ghetto".  white people who grew up their shouldn't be admonished for talking like that especially when talking to other people who also grew up there.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$Slur	the fucking hypocrisy of some 'gamers' is real.      buying games is about keeping the developers you love afloat and continuing the gaming hobby.

Neutral	balkanization is going to happen eventually. the federal government is too massive and too indebted to continue for much longer. letting it dissolve now instead of later will be like pulling off a band-aid instead of resorting to amputation.
Neutral	well i identified that way from about age 14-16. i never would have if i hadn't been on tumblr. i'm designated female at birth, and i never liked being a girl, mainly because of the way our society and past societies have treated women. also, i was always a bit of a "tom boy." so i thought the label "genderfluid" fit what i was going through. some days, i would feel masculine, and some days i would feel feminine and want to be perceived as such. i now realize those feelings were probably a result of me going through puberty.       side note: i also identified as asexual when i was 14. i think this is really messed up, as most 14-year-olds are too young to think about sex, yet being on tumblr and seeing that culture told me it was ok to identify that way and i wasn't too young to know i was asexual. it turns out i was just a lesbian with repressed feelings.      originally i decided to stop identifying as genderfluid because i started dating and i didn't feel like i could adequately explain it on a dating website (yes really), so i thought "if i'm not serious enough about this to explain it to someone i might date in the future, what's the point," so now i just identify as female.       this is now why i am so against tumblr identity politics. it's really messed up to see these kids go through what i had to go through because they were impressionable and misinformed. i've seen plenty of people who used to identify as "demiromantic lithrosexual bigender" when it turned out they were just gay or trans or even bisexual but they were young and wanted labels and didn't quite understand what they were going through. tumblr encourages this and shames people who disagree even though it's toxic and can set people who actually want to find an identity back a good 2 years.       tldr labels bad tumblr bad puberty and repressed lesbian feelings

IdentityDirectedAbuse	in the internet, people ignore the obvious and focus on details that often are not even there and just matter because of an autistic imagined connection between events.      like, if there were 10 people hanging out and somebody told this story, one guy would say "you asked her for a date, she rejected. so you asked another girl. yeah, best possible thing you can do." and the discussion would be over. but online, some idiot writes a thousand word reply why op is an asshole. in real life, nobody even would listen more than two sentences. and the guy would probably realize that he is dumb and just drop it himself after the 3rd sentence.

Neutral	here's another article where she does an interview and talks about how she went to the doctor and he gave her sleeping pills, if you're into that sort of thing.  it does also have a response from the company, which is interesting:      >the incident at the sterling heights assembly plant in february was the  subject of an exhaustive investigation conducted by external  investigators. although we have been unable to identify the person  responsible, if and when that person is identified, their relationship  with the company will be terminated. fca will continue to conduct  focused training to underscore the value of diversity and inclusion.  this type of behavior will simply not be tolerated.      they're either accepting that it was intended to be a noose, or just trying to hand-wave the case away.  i can see a million reasons why you'd fire somebody for improper use or equipment or leaving a safety hazard like that laying around, so it's easy enough to say "whoever did it will be fired", then change subjects and mention that you have a zero tolerance policy for harassment, even if it's unrelated to the reasons why you'd fire the person who left the rope out.

Neutral	> fans just need to accept sometimes their interpretation or theories on something is wrong and they totally missed the point.      wrong by what metric?  ray bradbury has said very explicitly that the central theme of fahrenheit 451 is, in his eyes, the dangers of mass media and illiteracy.  are the people who focus more heavily on the way that the story illustrates the dangers of censorship (i.e. the vast majority of people who read the book) objectively wrong for doing so?

Neutral	i definitely think that animal therapy programs are a good way to bridge that gap.  back in my uni years, i did a term project on animal-assisted therapy (i considered it as a career) and was just amazed at the metrics when it came to turning around juvenile offenders by placing them in care positions (such as with horses or rehabbing abused dogs).  the work done with the elderly and infirm, especially with cats and their purrs having bone growth properties are just amazing.      but again, a hospital, a nursing home is a place you can't even wear perfume.  you could, possibly, *kill* someone by bringing an animal inside an environment like that.  it's the kind of thing that has to be case-by-case and can't negatively impact innocent bystanders.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	you summed up perfectly the reasons why i am staunchly pro-life.      your point about how someone who kills a pregnant woman gets heavier punishment than someone killing a non pregnant woman highlights the mental gymnastics involved on if an unborn child is a living being.      i find it reprehensible that women are so entitled to demand the right to have unprotected sex without having to think about any of the likely outcomes and that they just casually have an abortion down the line. any society that promotes killing living beings like this under the guise of women's rights is a sick society.      very few abortion cases involve rape or incest yet those are the rare scenarios that pro-abortion women always try to use to defend abortion.

Neutral	burning all books to stop people from reading at all is 'clearly and indisputably' not the same thing as specifically censoring certain material.  it even says 'parts' right there in the definition you quoted to help.  the two things are in the same ballpark but not the same at all in intent or result.      bradbury making the story about burning all books was obviously going for something broader than censorship.  and whaddya know this aligns with what he actually said he was trying to talk about.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	there's been an upturn in the amount of people posting arguments they've taken part in. i'd vote to add it to rule 1, because it's the same mentality as what we laughed at the atheism subreddits back in the day.      tia is to laugh at these nutters through the glass bottomed boat.      edit: i also think op is going around downvoting those who disagree.
Neutral	you're not a libertarian
Neutral	i've heard people (even on this sub) say they got bullied for it, which is not necessarily specific to asexuals (people can be bullied for just about anything), but i thought it worth mentioning.      beyond that, the two biggest problems asexuals seem to face are 1) not knowing it's possible to be asexual and thinking there is something wrong with them if they don't want sex, and 2) loneliness in adulthood. this applies to aromantics as well. both groups blame society for the second one because of how romantic relationships are normalized to the exclusion of other relationship types (i'm told keeping friends can be difficult when everyone else in your group is married), and romantic relationships after one's teenage years are expected to involve sex.      true, the oppression aces face doesn't remotely compare to a gay or bi person being killed for their sexuality, but it also isn't nothing.      this is not to be confused with the ***totally valid oppressions*** (read that with a heavy dose of sarcasm) of being kicked out of the lgbt community... *for not being oppressed enough*, and not seeing enough people like themselves in fiction and the media. those are mere symptoms of the deeper problem, and yet they are the things tumblr and twitter aces seem to get the most pissy about.

Neutral	> if someone wants to take the risk and go helmetless, knowing what they are getting themselves into, they should have the right to make that choice - even if i don't personally agree with the merits of it.      a factor that people like this forget is that wrecklessly endangering yourself doesn't just increase the risk of injury and death, it wastes medical resources as well.      emts are often overworked and rushing to get from one emergency to another. by not wearing a seatbelt or helmet, a minor accident potentially goes from something you walk away from to something where emts have to lose time trying to stabilise and/or resuscitate you. this being time in which they might not be able to attend to people who got hurt for non-moronic reasons, read: not because they were too stubborn to take basic safety precautions.

Neutral	> in fact let's ask the saudi education system, which condemns all other muslim groups.   >    > the official religious school [because islam is not a monolithic bloc] of the saudis is wahhabism, which didn't emerge until the 1700s, and while sadly strong, is not a majority school, even if you count its salafi and deobandi affiliates.      precisely, you nailed it. wahhabism isn't just strong, is the biggest influence because of the power of saudi arabia, a country that not only has an almost unlimited amount of resources but also uses them to spread as much propaganda as they want.      i'm all up for reforming islam, throwing all the backwards shit away and putting it under control like the west did with the church. but right now, that just isn't the case.

Neutral	nah half of them are just critiques of leftist ideology. i don't know why you define a whole sub as incels and bigots because you saw a few that you didn't like and a few alt-righters there.       having been part of that sub for a few days and engaged with them, i can tell you most are just regular conservatives.       unless of course you meant to say "anyone who is remotely right is guilty of [insert ad hominem here]" which is the type of mentality most of the memes poked fun of.      a minority of racist, sexist etc memes are no reason to quarantine a sub.

Neutral	the main reason why avatar got so popular in the first place was that is was one of the first movies available in 3d. whilst it is a good movie i don't think it deserves to be above star wars or titanic. so i think it's understandable that people want that to be replaced by a movie that people were psyched about because of the story and the hype. plus, i doubt anyone went to see endgame with the idea of helping it beat avatar.

Neutral	most people want to feel useful in life, i think. what i'm trying to let you know is that at 19 you have a lot of life left to be useful.       i really do understand how hard it can be to feel alone. i was homeless when i was 20 and felt much the same as you describe above. i got a job at 21 that enabled me to get a place to live, from there i continued to just try to find some way to be useful and find people that i could 'belong' with. it didn't always work, and it was certainly difficult at times, but there were also lots of little triumphs that helped spur me along.      don't give up just yet. you really don't know who you're going to be there for later on. that person might make it all worthwhile. it just might take time.

Neutral	porn is a separate realm of its own and often uses things that might be seen harmful for the enjoyment of both the viewer and the performer, so i'm not going to dig into that. but in media, even if the character is male identifying, the term trap still suggests malevolence. in addition, the difference from trans women isn't always clear, so the audience could connect the term to them even if that's not the purpose. terms like crossdresser or even transvestite seem much better to me.

Neutral	thank you.  the funny thing about the whole incident was that a lot of older posters and the mods liked, and did not disagree, with my post.  but, they claimed that there were many who didn't and after months of being told i was an awesome mod, they were suddenly changing the rules and trying to make drama out of a post where i essentially said, "act like an adult and understand that people disagree now and then."  ironic, no?   as far as everything else goes, i was offered the chance to stay on as a mod...but, with no posting power.  i chose to leave because it made no sense that a post that didn't break the tos and was well received by the majority of the community would earn a punishment. when certain forum members started sharing details that should've remained within the four mods...i bounced because it was clear that information was being shared with non-mods, but friends of mods.   in fact, i was happy to stay quiet and allow bygones to be bygones until i noted that the person who created the most drama was running her mouth in other places trying to bad mouth me.  whatever ,it's reddit, but there's not enough time in the day to dedicate yourself to silencing someone because you want to be snarkier than everyone else.  i wish that forum nothing but good things and i'm disappointed it went down the way it did.

Neutral	i could smell the farts before i even clicked. a beta circlejerk is such a sad sight.
Neutral	i've got some questions for you.      - **how old is your child?**      - **is your child the 1 most important thing in the world to you?**      - **do you still love this woman?** (i'd be surprised if you didn't).      these are the important things you need to answer to understand and make a proper decision on what to do from here on. being cheated on is a dreadful thing to experience but since there's a child involved here, hasty moves or bad decisions will affect the child more than it will affect you or her.      you don't have to give me the answers but at the very least, answer them for yourself and remember that your child is the most important thing to think about right now.       if your child is under 18, a divorce won't wreck the child's life but it'll turn their world upside down quite a bit. likewise, if you stay together, i can see the resentment building up and cause marital issues at home and if the child is present while they take place, it'll affect them badly as well.      you have financial problems as well that could come out of a divorce. you'll have to pay child support (likely). alimony is another problem you'll (probably) encounter. you'll have less say in your child's life if your child chooses to live with the mother. you won't get to see the child as much as much.       if you still love her then this makes this whole thing ten times harder than it already is. you can't help it but it's really not going to help you either. she might cheat on you again, she may even be cheating on you right now with a new person and you wouldn't even know it.      if you still have concerns about her cheating on you again, what would be the best course of action is to "separate" but only in your relationship and not your marriage. this is so the child gets the best benefit out of this. you're both still married, you live in the same house, you both take care of the kid but you're no longer "together".      that way, if she decides to cheat on you again, it won't cause any issues. you'll also be free to seek other women as well for your own benefit as well. and once the child reaches the age of 18 (or until the child moves out), you can decide to divorce her and forget about her.      but if you feel you can actually work it out properly and still have a proper relationship then you should try to do just that. it's down to your judgement ultimately. just remember, there's absolutely no reason why she wouldn't cheat again. she managed to hide this one from you for four years and you couldn't do a thing about it. *she had to tell you* and it was only because she couldn't handle the guilt anymore and even then, it was because she felt sorry for herself and not you.      i have to tell you, i'd be paranoid all the time. every single time she went out and came home late, "*is she fucking another guy again?*" every time she's on the phone, "*is she texting another guy? what are they talking about?*" every time she acts weird, down or strange, "*is she feeling guilty because she fucked another guy again?*"      or she doesn't want sex with you, "*did she already have sex with another guy? has she been cheating again?*" this is but a taste of what it feels like being with a person that has admitted to cheating on you. it's mental torture of insecurity, paranoia and heartbreak and you'll hate every second of it.      jesus, it'd be pretty bad, so do it how you want to do it but make sure the child doesn't get punished for it. look after your own mental health as well and don't brutalize or mentally torture your wife either.      if you're feeling angry or sad, don't make any decisions until the feeling passes.       i wish you good luck, bud.

PersonDirectedAbuse	all april fools jokes are stupid...      but as for your main point, no. it's not like he was explicitly making fun of people with fertility issues. he didn't pretend that they miscarried. he pretended that his wife, a biological woman, is pregnant. something that happens to women all the time.       whilst i can sympathise with the struggles, and i do understand that it can be triggering to see other people getting pregnant or having a healthy pregnancy when you can't, it's a bit ridiculous and unfair to take that out on everyone else. it's nobody's fault that some people have fertility issues and demanding that everyone else avoid the subject to make you feel better is silly and frankly selfish.       quit playing victim and build a platform to discuss the issue in a productive and non-aggressive manner.
Neutral	it is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both. cao cao's character is greatly informed by his orders and actions, alternately being merciful or merciless, generous or greedy, piously adoring or rebelliously denouncing his superiors as is most expedient in the shrewdness of the moment. he simply has no underlying morality, though this is not unique among the novel's main characters. what may make cao so infamous is not only how successful this made him, but also that he made fewer oblations to filial piety part of his core public identity. his greatest rivals, the suns and wu, the yuans, shu, all make high profile acts of familial devotion and their close relationships (also often quite shrewd) pr talking points everywhere, cao cao does not bother except as necessary and expedient.       for example, shu plays a constant shell game of political heat between the oath brothers and they become masters at it. the most notable time cao does something similar is at the very end of his life, where he orchestrates a quick shuffle with his son where cao cao formally deposes the emperor and installs cao pi shortly before his death, then the new emperor posthumously pardons and recognizes his father as the actual first emperor of their dynasty.

Neutral	how do we know there are tribal peoples a couple of hundred years old? what's the source for that?      anecdotally, last year i met a shaman from siona tribe of the putumayo province in the colombian amazon .      he spent all his life walking bare-foot around in the jungle, drank ayahuasca for the first time when he was 7 or 8. the first time he saw the sea, was when he went to europe last year.      he died a few days ago at age 113 or 114 following a stroke during a plane-trip to mexico.      he looked maybe 90 when i met him. his 60 year old son looked about 40.      other than being a master shaman who has helped thousands upon thousands of people, he was one of the kindest persons i've met.      while his body had indeed become old and somewhat weak, the power inside him was unmistakable, especially during the ceremonies.       when he stayed with me, he told me, "you're one of my grandchildren too, now." i wish i had been able to visit the tribe in december as i had planned.      surupa, abuelo, may you benefit countless beings in the future.

Neutral	i'm not sure if that sort of thing didn't apply to european kings, an unfit, unpopular ruler did not stay one for long during the medieval period. it may be that a critical analysis of divine right might be difficult for any learned man of the period to write down without having his tongue cut out and being boiled in oil. there are certainly many cases of western feudal lords withdrawing their loyalties and oaths at convenient or politically expedient times in a not too dissimilar manner to the collapse of the han.

Neutral	yeah i think you're right. i asked parkranger about banning and she said something really vague about some people being banned for shady reasons during all the turmoil, and that she was willing to revisit those bans yet she wouldn't confirm who was doing the questionable banning. i don't know if it was her, trailangel, or some other mod. but she did reinstate some people who had been banned. who knows! i think at this point if the mods don't reign in the people who started the drama (who trailangel called the old guard) things will continue to spiral. but i think the old guard folks have too much power and influence with the mods so there is unlikely to be any action taken against the people who are stirring up the drama & so the drama will continue.

Neutral	the only way you're going to get most people to contribute to the wellbeing of some toothless, obese, wife-beating, pill-popping fuck in appalachia is to take it from us by force. there's no way to "live as a collective" with someone hundreds of miles away who you've never met and would find objectively revolting if you did. collectivism is a meme that requires local proximity, cultural similarity, and a disproportionate amount of small-scale bullshit politics. if you don't currently have or want to have any of those, it's not remotely feasible. "muh corporashuns" are trying to sell you some sort of constructed ideal to embody, but that doesn't mean you can just assert group identity to 300m+ people and expect them to all love and support one another out of the goodness of their hearts.
Neutral	this is the opposite of what we want!
Neutral	i don't even know what to think anymore! i asked parkranger for some clarification on some questionable banning (i.e. of people who aren't snarking "correctly" or are being banned for disagreeing rather than rule breaking) and she said, in part "we did do some un-banning, if that's a word, and i'm absolutely happy to look deeper into users who think they've been banned unfairly. we don't blindly ban here."

Neutral	antinatalism is not a strong position imo, but you're making bad arguments against it      > if you are alive, you can enjoy a delicious slice of pizza. therefore by your logic, i have found one reason to exist, ergo the only possible conclusion is that you should have children.      by whose logic? i've never heard an antinatalist argue that there are literally no positives to being alive. their arguments usually fall into these categories:      - the challenges or bad parts of life do outweigh the good      - even if they don't, it's difficult to prove it convincingly enough to justify action (creating a life and rolling the dice) vs inaction (not creating a life, neutral result)      - even if you prove the utilitarian case convincingly enough, you've argued yourself into a moral imperative to have literally as many children as possible      if you're like the overwhelming majority of people, being alive is obviously better than not being alive, and it's absurd to question it. but it's not the case for everyone. imagine if your experience of life (the only experience you truly have access to) were overwhelmingly negative, and you genuinely would have preferred to have never been born. can you see how the decision to create another life would seem morally ambiguous from that perspective?

Neutral	you're right - i'm using "gore" as a catch all term for videos of people suffering and/or dying. for me, they're all in the same category. the only difference is the level of brutality. it's like the difference between soft core porn and hardcore porn. fills the same desire.       i'm not even saying i've never watched. i was all over rotten.com when i was young and the internet was new. it took a while for me to realize that those videos hurt you on a deep level that you cannot conceive of at the time. the effect is cumulative and it's permanent. i will never in my life forget the image of someone's head being sawed off with a knife, or a woman's toddler being hit by a train while her back was turned. too many terrible memories that shouldn't have to be mine, or anyone else's.
Neutral	if you don't want to listen to a reasoned argument and talk about the context, it is not worth my time continuing the discussion. i'm sitting in a coffee shop right now, on vacation, enjoying a medieval european city. there are better things for me to do with my time, today, believe you me.      however, when a child dies at the hands of wrong headed policies, it alarms me enough to do the work i think i need to do in order to see that those policies change. i'm just an anonymous commenter on reddit, but i will do what i can.
Neutral	but dont worry, its not even racism! /s
Neutral	because when things are grouped together incorrectly without further context it creates cognitive dissonance. think back to sats or something similar - "which of these do not belong" type questions. our brains are trained to look for patterns and when we cannot find the similarities, or there are glaring discrepancies it creates cognitive discomfort.       you're saying it's obvious to you that some things are worse than others. i'm saying, based on the text, the author is not making that point explicitly or implicitly which is confusing. you're making an assumption. i'm going off of what is written. no where does the other make any distinction.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$IdentityDirectedAbuse	another scandalous aspect of this -- north korea is not communist.       they quietly dropped all references to marx/lenin/etc. back in 1992 and right now it is just a somewhat quirky but not that abnormal in the grand scheme of human history regime of theocratic feudal despotism (the religion being the cult of personality surrounding the kims).       so why on earth would a r/communism moderator feel the need to ban anyone for criticizing it (setting aside  for a moment that people should only ever be banned for real and serious offenses)? that is somewhat equivalent to someone in the ussr being sent to a gulag camp in the 1930s for criticizing mussolini...      but then have you ever seen an sjw who knows anything about history and philosophy...       in fact the whole sjw phenomenon is to a large degree born out of the total collapse of education in those areas over the last few decades and is sustained by the militant ignorance of the younger generations.

Neutral	we need to teach women not to rape. particularly, not to rape children.      the one trait most common in men jailed for sexual crimes against women is that more than 80% of them report being raped or molested by an adult woman as a child.      there is literally not a single more useful thing adult women can do to reduce the amount of sexual violence they suffer at the hands of adult men then stop raping them while they are children.

Neutral	press s to spit on europe.
Neutral	i know this is two days old, but i'll give it a shot.      it comes from selective understanding. both of those points aren't necessarily contradictory depending on just how you're viewing them and how you're making those points.      the idea of piracy not being a lost sale comes from the idea that a number of people who pirate games would not buy it in the first place, and would only play it if they can pirate it. think teenagers without their own spending money, or people trying out a game because they *can* without paying, but wouldn't bother trying it if they had to pay for it. the idea of it potentially helping comes from these same people enjoying the game and recommending it to other people, who in turn actually pay for the game. along with some of the people who pirate it enjoying it to the point where they want to support the devs.      where this comes to potentially hurting the developers, well, the important phrase in the last paragraph is "a number of people". as we can see from these threads, the people who wouldn't buy it anyway aren't all of the people who pirate. they may not even be a large portion at all. for example, the people in this thread saying or implying they'll pirate it would otherwise buy the game if it was on steam. they're doing it to stick it to the man in their eyes, because they *are* lost sales. and they're using the fact they don't want to support the epic games store as a moral excuse.       essentially, they are valid points, assuming the "lost sale" defense is based in reality which i can't comment on. but a lot of these people just want any moral excuse to pirate games and will use whatever feels the most convenient. instead of just pirating and accepting it's wrong to do, but they don't care.

Neutral	i agree with this sentiment about cao cao being the best warlord. liu bei just happened to have the best advisors and some of the best generals at his side, and prevented others from having the same.      one of the most infuriating instances between the two was when lu bu was captured by cao cao, and cao cao was having tea with liu bei. he asked liu bei if he would spare lu bu. lu bu, a skilled warrior, would have become a problem for liu bei in the future so he convinced cao cao to kill him... completely disregarding the fact that lu bu had saved him before. i really don't understand how someone like this is usually presented as the "hero" of the three kingdoms.

Neutral	nature isn't a wonderful, peaceful place, and anyone who thinks it is, is delusional. everything wants to kill you, the elements, other animals, diseases, ect. it doesn't inherently provide for you.       if you walk into a forrest expecting to gather plentiful food and clean water, you will die. the food you will find will taste terrible and take a ton of effort to gather or hunt enough of to actually be nourishing. the water will always be dirty and taste disgusting.      i get the appeal, it's a pretty place to visit. it's easy to embellish the peace and beauty when you don't see predators covered in the blood of their prey, or a rabid animal being painfully reducing to a brain dead mess.      be happy for human advancement. take pride in the machines we've build and the plentiful resources we've made for ourselves because nature doesn't care. it never has, and our advancement as a species has come inspite of nature, not because of it.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	this is the lgbtq movement in a nutshell.  the western world is in vast agreement that people should be able to do whatever they want in their bedrooms as long as it's consensual.  the lgbtq movement says that's not enough, they need to be able to force you *and your kids* to look at them and be told they're lifestyle is superior to yours.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	and no one should. i've noticed that comments on inceltears are usually loaded with sympathy and insistence that they're just "lonely, misguided guys". the type of sympathy you never see for misogynists in the middle east or india, that you never, ever would see for a misandrist or "radical feminist". many of these men fantasize about violently raping and murdering women, openly. reddit's response?       "let's not be concerned. they wouldn't have the guts to do it in real life."      nevermind the real life attacks driven by incel culture that have already taken place, carried out by men that incels openly admire.       the other day i had a pedophile apologist on there telling me that incels  who idealize underage girls are just opportunistic and not "real pedophiles", because "real pedophiles are afraid to hurt children and live in self-loathing." huh? if that were even remotely true, child sex trafficking would cease entirely. if it were remotely true, pedophiles would pose no threat to society. people really believe this virtuous pedophile shit. not saying there are none who are like that and are seeking help, but this idea that most of them are just friendly guys who don't have any desire to act on their compulsions?       deserves a second post. no sympathy for self-identified incels. no sympathy for pedophiles or mysoginists, western or otherwise. plenty of people are lonely, plenty of people are shy, plenty of people have social anxiety and are unattractive, yet most are not incels and don't subscribe to incel culture. why? because it attracts people who are shitty. the end.       if inceldom were a predominantly non-white movement, most people would acknowledge them as a legitimate terrorist threat and not just harmless losers who don't know any better.       phew..

Slur	in the us, calling someone a spaz could be considered insulting depending on the context, but not on the level of "retard" or even "idiot" or "fool".  more along the lines of "ditz" or "dope" in that it's generally perceived as playful rather than derogatory.

Neutral	this is completely misplaced.      people aren't celebrating steam's monopoly on the market. people are complaining that *publishers themselves* are forcing consumers' hands by setting up their own stores. apart from the fact that a lot of people just don't like the idea of giving certain publishers a bigger cut than they already receive, you need to consider that, paradoxically, this type of competition is actually anti-consumer.      it's anti-consumer because, when these titles compete on steam, they compete more directly. consumers have more alternatives: if i don't like one publisher's product, there's another publisher's product just a few clicks away. often the two are competing right next to each other. that means games need to compete with each other on quality and on price.      when every aaa publisher owns their own storefront which exclusively sells their titles, they don't face such direct competition, and can conduct themselves accordingly: indeed, this is often their express intent in setting up their own storefronts. fewer discounts, less scrutiny, more control over fan reactions, higher margins.      if you don't like steam's monopolization of the market, you need to outline the alternative program, not just cheer as publishers carve it up and leave consumers behind.

Neutral	well almost everyone from those times sucked. i recently went over roman history once more and it was pretty spectacular how much insanity was just glanced over in my school years. like how generals like caesar basically started wars for personal profit and downright genocided major areas. i can't find the exact numbers anymore but i believe the historians' estimates were that around 40% of gauls may have died  in the gallic wars, with entire tribes marked for annihiliation.      the used to be celebrated for introducing culture and democracy into my country, and while teaching did include that things got bloody, it's pretty jarring to see just how much.
Neutral	you don't have to learn things if you pretend that the teachers are wrong

Neutral	it is the truth, anyone can be raped, and it's always a serious issue no matter who is the rapist and who the victim.
PersonDirectedAbuse	there's multiple layers to it but in the context of the culture war, people are still sour over ghostbusters and more so the last jedi and how disney seems to be handling their franchises. they see captain marvel (cm) as being shoehorned into the mcu, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the russo brothers have clashed with disney over cm's role in end game. the marvel comics are also recovering from some "forced diveristy" issues that has completely tanked their sales (e.g., female thor). in short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products.      more specifically, brie larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. in the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as snooty and posh. even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which she has been accused of before. gotta pay those bills though, i guess.      the trailers drop for cm and people are unimpressed. this causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive "incels are back to ruin cm" narrative. this attracts negative attention and people go to rotten tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. this intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. the shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger.      the movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider "woke". rotten tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. people fed up with the  "sjwing" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about trump's america being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, gamergater incels. the fact that the film has moments that would even make the recent gillette commercial blush isn't helping lol

Neutral	hey varysisamermaid69! thank you for your submission, unfortunately it has been removed from [USER] because:      * surplus popcorn.      due to a lot of stale politicized drama crowding out niche posts and dominating the front page, certain categories of drama face greater scrutiny and greater rates of removal.     your post fell into one of these categories and was not exceptional enough to be approved. see here for more information.       surplus drama categories include:      * racism drama   * gender wars   * social justice drama   * gun drama   * partisan pissmatches            for more on our rules, please check out our detailed rules wiki.  if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to [message the moderators]([URL]).
Neutral	i wish i were kidding. i can't link names anymore because i don't want to get suspended for mentioning this user *again*, but i had a very high karma thread here removed by the anti-evil team that posted a pm conversation between me and [highest karma user] where he outed himself (jocularly or not) as a paid advertiser for companies, etc., and well...      i got suspended for seven days for "harassment".      today on the **sixth day** it was finally reversed via appeal. my appeal was simple. there is no harassment if someone messages **you** and never once indicates in the messages that they wish to stop receiving messages. that very clearly means they want to keep talking to you.      not once did [highest karma user] *ever* indicate he didn't want to receive further messages from me! in fact, the last pm i had sent him was to never contact me again, which he somewhat complied with, well, until he had his cronies (the reddit admins) falsely suspend me.      posting private messages (of which he was going to do anyway, evident by how he used it to rally brigades against me and many others) is a bit crass but **not** against the rules whatsoever.      tl;dr: do **not** talk to power users or anyone who may have an agenda against you. reddit admins don't actually look at harassment reports---they just take them at face value and assume the report is true. an appeal will likely be listened to at some point if you're not being a tool within it and **have clear and concise proof that they not only initiated conversation but never said "stop talking to me" or anything to that effect**, but it'll be near the end of the suspension anyway.

Neutral	no one needs to recruit anyone, these freaks are chasing away people themselves
Neutral	what's more important than a "thank you email" is just a followup email. you don't have to be pushy about it, but if after a week, you haven't heard from the employer, just send them a quick email reaffirming your interest in the position. you don't have to ask anything specific either, just reaffirming your interest is enough. oftentimes, the employer will appreciate your initiative if you do so.      ... never thought i'd have to bring in this up an argument about white and black people.
Neutral	see, i actually enjoy and see the value of reading symbolism into things. but i can understand how the somewhat artificial and forced experience (asking students to write a several page essay on the subject tends to lead to some high levels of reaching in finding symbolism) you tend to get in english classes can leave some people a bit jaded by the whole thing. sometimes a banana is just a banana.
Neutral	there are 7 billion people on this planet. billions upon billions of women and young women have given birth. it's what happens. bringing a child into this world under less than desirable circumstances is not the end of the world. i know a woman who gave birth at 15, became a dental hygienist and took care of her child. was it the perfect situation? of course not, but she is a good woman with a good life. if you end up not being pregnant then maybe get on some type of birth control . if you are pregnant just remember a child is for life and does bring a type of love you only get from being a mother. think long and hard about abortion and what that may bring to your life as well.

Neutral	cops in my city do that shit too, often ticketing cyclists for things that are legal, the cops just don't care to learn bike laws. they also do things like claim someone didn't have their bike light on when they did. or one time, my friend was walking his bike across the street because of a flat, in a crosswalk, when a car hit him. the cops gave my friend a ticket for *not having his lights on* even though he wasn't riding his bike, he was walking.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i will say in critique of it that while i largely agree with blanchard's typology, he pretty clearly only cares about mtf trans issues, and his theories just kind of ignore that ftm people exist.       also it doesn't really cope with the idea of someone being bisexual, which it seems like the majority of trans people actually are. the typology pretty much assumes that everyone is either 100% straight or 100% gay, and just realllly fucked up sexually when it comes to kinks.      personally, i'd say that with the inclusion of tumblrite aap gaydens and the acknowledgement of bisexuality being a reason for potential agp/aap behavior due to a wider spectrum of attractive features leading to a fetishization of one's own attractive features, it would be a nigh-on perfect system.
Neutral	i mean, it's sad that this is probably a tit for tat. it's a little coincidental that these 'restrictive' abortion laws came months after new york made abortions 9 months into a pregnancy legal and celebrated it. then it was followed up with a governor talking about 'post birth' abortion.      i think abortion was at as good a place it could be.  one side tipped the scale & alarmed a bunch of conservative states.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse$PersonDirectedAbuse	to be fair, socialists are probably the worst people to ask about socialism, as cultists tend to have compromised opinions about their cults.       seriously, i've been reading engels lately, and the guy's a fucking hack. i swear you could go through his work and find-and-replace-text, and change every instance of "necessarily" to "mystically", and every example of "necessary" to "eldritch", and it would read exactly the same way. anyone who'd read his drivel and view it as innovation to be implemented, that's some jonestown-tier decision making...jonestown itself having been a socialist commune, i suddenly recall.

Neutral	> most common non professionals have no clue      the lack of knowledge about immunity from most pro-vax people would be comical if the things they want weren't so worrying.      i saw a post on another sub about a mother having a kids party but she had a new born baby as well so she didn't want any kids there who hadn't been vaccinated. another mother was looking after her kid and her kids friend, who hadn't been vaccinated but was apparently completely healthy. she took both of them to the party but was asked to leave when the mother with the baby found out that the kid wasn't vaccinated.       everyone in the reddit post was slamming the 2nd mother, saying she was evil, a horrendous person, that she put the baby's life at risk etc. no-one seemed to have a clue about babies having passive immunity and they were automatically assuming that the unvaccinated kid was a health risk even though she was healthy and completely symptom free.

Neutral	background: 21 years old, chubby, friendless, haven't kissed a girl or even held her hand yet. i feel like i've missed out on a lot of things i should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up.      every day is as boring as the previous one. if someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face.      it's sad, man. every year i feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. i wish i could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. the list goes on. but sadly, i can't change my past.      what's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. yes, i do have overprotective parents, but i should have done something. if only i had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where i was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time i opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different.      nowadays, i often act against my own interests solely out of fear. for example: some weeks ago, i messaged a girl i had been texting for around a month (i don't know if i like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if i actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since i didn't get an answer half an hour later i decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed.      right after waking up, i saw her reply. she answered 10 minutes after i knocked myself out. said she was at some club and told me to drop by if i wanted. a few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if i wanted to go. and that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour.      what did i do? i saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know i saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why i couldn't answer earlier. even though i really wanted to see her.      my lack of social skills angers me. i know i would've done the exact same thing if i hadn't gone to bed before her reply. why? because i fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). the beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, i'm not happy with my body at all.      it's not that i'm an introvert. socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. it kills me when i find something funny on the internet and i have no one to share it with. or when i want to go to the movies or something and i have no one to go with. i dislike being by myself most of the time. i'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. or even go on vacations with, like some do. but since i tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and i usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. and i'd love to go to nightclubs, but i don't have the social skills to really enjoy it.      i've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. lost 6% bodyfat but i 'gave up' again two weeks ago. i'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. that the door has already closed. the same dumb questions arise: "why would i want to be ripped at 22? will i even be able to catch up with social skills? will it even be worth it?".      any advice is welcome.

Neutral	there are a lot of nuclear facilities that are fruitful and operate well. unfortunately, i live in the uk where we have sellafield, possibly the most controversial and worst kept nuclear site in europe. a lot of people are scared and skeptical about nuclear power in the uk, and rightly so, trawsfynydd is another site that is in the process of decommissioning.              from what i've gathered, trawsfynydd won't be fully decommissioned until 2100ish, that's a very fucking long clean up process considering it was closed down in the 90's.              a professor actually carried out a study and managed to gather some data which indicated the cooling water which cooled trawsfynydd (which is next to a lake/reservoir, the only in-land power plant in the country) was causing abnormalities and cancers in the direction the wind blew from the plant. there are reporting of contaminated fish and many different leaks of material reported at trawsfynydd over the years, a lot of them covered up.              these were magnox reactors though, they're known for being quite 'dirty' in comparison to other production methods available now.              nuclear energy is interesting, however, after chernobyl a lot of people are scared of radiation and do not really understand it other than knowing it is a silent killer if things go wrong.              i'd rather have wind turbines etc, but we are facing a lot of backlash in the uk due to birds being killed by them, lmao.

Neutral	eh i am okay with this my family were die hard loyalists and got exiled to canada after the american revolution. though i find this a humorous take because the american founders were way more liberal than the very conservative british state. i mean this person forgets that the house of lords in the uk has representatives from the church of england.       being a loyalist usually meant your were more conservative most of the founding fathers were deists, had very radical beliefs on christianity or weren't religious all. this person is just assuming because europe today is more liberal than the us that was the case back then when it was the inverse.      also nice insinuation that racism, sexism, rape or pedophilia has anything to do with christianity and that its non existence would prevent those crimes.

"it's terrible, so terrible." guys? "dude, up top! fuck yeah!"      this shit needs to stop. nobody likes it, it fucks you up so bad. my life has been a terrible mess since it's happened, i'm struggling to get myself back together. i'm thankful for my best friend and girlfriend for sticking by me through this.       i just needed to get this off my chest.

Neutral	today, after waiting for 2 whole months i got the result from my college. i'm a 3d artist and i have been looking for a job in animation industry for a year but with no luck. i had been doing some other jobs for a living or freelancing. i thought maybe i'll have a better way of getting more contacts and  opportunities if join a college for my masters program. so i applied to a college and today i finally got my result from the college and it was a rejection. our result is based on a portfolio so they mentioned it wasn't competitive enough.       im very passionate about animation and art and i know this is where i'm headed and i already have the knowledge and already making my own movie. however, the result may have pushed me to push myself more, i somehow low-key feel like after all these years (i started 3d art a long time ago and also have a degree btw) i'm still useless and not worth it. it made me question my own art. i know i'm not that good but i know i'm not that bad either.       overall, i have faith in mother nature and there must be a good reason behind why this happened. i'm still not giving up and moving forward everyday.       tldr; same as the title.      edit:    so 2 days ago,  i got a mail from the same university and from being rejected i have now been accepted. i'm more than happy to have this opportunity.

Neutral	we're currently living in a material universe in which power trumps all, "good" and "evil" are more or less human perspectives, i think we have been conditioned to believe in some sort of judgment from a higher power but the more i learn about the universe the more i realize that everything comes from balancing a dualistic force and the universe itself seems to be set on neutral, there is no preference for the dark or the light but only cause and effect within its laws of physics. take a lion for an example, if it doesn't eat it will die, so it finds an antelope and devours it for sustenance, from the lions perspective this is good but from the antelopes perspective the lion is evil, in the end the world is naturally designed to favour the more powerful force.      i'm not saying god, hell and judgment don't exist but looking at the natural order of things if there is a god, higher realms and heaven, then it's found beyond the material. here on earth the only thing that matters is power. if you ponder this sort of thing allot i would look into gnosticism, the gnostics believe that the material world was created by a demi god and that's why it's dualistic and imperfect.

Neutral	if you're under the impression that vaccines are safe for everyone and don't cause injury and death, then you're either uninformed, in denial, or outright lying at this juncture.       since the first vaccines were created for smallpox, doctors knew and it was firmly established that brain inflammation, permanent brain damage and death have always been among most serious complications with vaccinations.      just in case you weren't aware of it the national childhood vaccine injury act was passed precisely because the number of lawsuits being filed against the vaccine manufactures for vaccine injuries and the losses they were incurring when they were consistently found to be guilty and held responsible for those injuries and personal damages in court was jeopardizing both their profits and even their continued existence.      you want to begin this conversation, that's where it should commence from. also take not that vaccines are not considered to be "drugs" nor are they held to the same rigorous and lengthy scientific testing that is applied to them, their efficacy, and any potential side-effects or long term effects that result from them.      by 1986 both congress and the u.s. supreme court had declared vaccines to be "unavoidably unsafe" and proceeded to deliberately shield the drug companies from any and all product liability for the vaccines they made and sold.       if you or your child was injured or died after a vaccination, you couldn't hold the drug company that made and profited from it or anyone who regulates, promotes, administers or mandates the vaccine accountable in a civil court of law in front of a jury of your peers.      now anyone with product safety liability can be sued when any flaws in that products design or construction results in harm to any unsuspecting person that used and relied on them but not the vaccine manufacturers. doctors can also be sued for malpractice **except** when they administer vaccinations that cause an injury or kill someone.      vaccines are the only product that the government both mandates and completely indemnifies with the over 3 billion already paid out in compensation for the serious injuries that have been proven to have been directly caused by them being charged back to the taxpayers.      now it should be patently obvious that the more vaccines that are administered to individual children the greater the likelihood that those kind of injuries are going to take place among them and  that is precisely what has happened and is increasingly happening.

Neutral	> was i kind to him? well, no.      i'm just wondering what magical words you found to get this type of reaction.  i've gotten more bans than i could even count and have replied with all sorts of insane shit to the modmail.  i think i told one to hurry back to his circlejerk before he missed his cumshower...told another to suck the diarrhea out of my ass with a straw...just whatever craziness happened to pop into my head at the moment that was a bit more creative than telling them to shove their sub up their ass.  but never got suspended.      i guess it depends on what mod it is.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	in other tia posts i noted that gender identity activists don't merely want the right to be who they are or to be treated as just another human being, they want *preferential* treatment. which is how they can accuse statements rooted in biology to be "transphobic," because it gets in the way of being treated preferentially to the rest of the population.       that's also how you can still be considered a hateful, harmful, *dangerous* person even if you treat transgendered people the same way you'd respectfully treat anyone else. i have a strong suspicion the fellow claiming tia is a hate sub considers anyone who *doesn't* provide enthusiastic praise for being trans as "hateful," hence why i mentioned the anakin skywalker mentality.      which would necessarily include a lot of the transgendered/nonbinary tia regulars who aren't fond of this shit either. then again, activists like these are quite notorious for treating dissent among their own favored demographics as treason.

Neutral	the outliers prove these differences are not innate, but cultural. if they were innate, they would be present in every culture. that's the "magical math" you describe.   my mother is a doctor, yet she still managed to have two children. you can be pregnant and have children while being and training to be a doctor.    it's just not easy for most moms and even dads, due to huge daycare costs and minimal maternal and no paternal leave. i think improving the childcare system in this country would help a lot more women be able to be both a parent and a doctor.   can we at least agree on that?
Neutral	casual sex happens and when it happens to teenagers without fully developed brains they do stupid things like forget to pull out or wear a condom. people make mistakes and having sex is not like buying a car. it sometimes happens spontaneously and with primal urges. it's easy to say or should have worn a condom but talk like that solves nothing because it will happen millions of times today. hold people accountable with life long punitive damage to them and all involved(the baby). jc once said, "he who is without sin shall cast the first stone." have any of the pro lifers made a mistake or sinned?
Neutral	random number generators are better at generating random distributions of cards than most players do irl. very few people shuffle enough times, *and* with proper technique to achieve true deck randomization, especially if there's shuffle library effects in the deck due to how tedious it is. furthermore, a lot of players do some form of mana weaving to stack their decks. a common technique is to immediately pile shuffle into 8 or 10 piles after a game to "split up" the mana chunks so subsequent poor deck randomization is less punishing.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	exactly, subscribing to an incel ideology is not an acceptable response to being lonely/forever alone - and a fair amount of those alone people are women so good luck getting many of them to subscribe to incel culture. it's fine to feel sympathy for people who are lonely, but that should not make it somehow understandable that they turn to an ideology of such bitter hatred towards women. and not just hatred in the abstract but sometimes with calls to violence towards women, a lamenting of rights granted to women and theorising about systems which would rob women of their sexual autonomy - if not more.      the sympathetic portrayal of the movement by some and, indeed, the movement itself is part of a wider spread of white cishet male identity politics. it is quite obvious that there is a large segment of the internet that revels in misfortune happening to people who aren't in the in-group (white cishet men). this group is a spectrum of people from those who think feminists are crazy all the way to people so radical that they will commit real-world acts of violence. the more general groups (which you can see on subreddits like justiceserved and the now-defunct cringe anarchy) react with sympathy towards people within the in-group and the opposite to "the other". and this movement is also a spectrum in what they focus on - some focus on the racial aspect, some focus on that of gender and some focus on sexuality - though they often share the views of the other groups and the overall theme is being reactionary towards threats to the privilege of white cishet men.      in my view, incel-ism is a facet of this aspect of internet culture, with men becoming the focused in-group and women becoming the other. and, because of this, the more moderate section of this trend of identity politics will feel sympathy to them because of what they perceive as slights by society against men as a whole and they don't want to sound like a "crazy feminist". though, by this point, incel ideology has become so famously toxic that much of the "centrist" h3h3/rogan crowd will - rightly -  throw them under the bus.      so, i do feel sympathy for the lonely part of their existence and it is sad that they can so easily become caught up in such a toxic ideology and it is devious how overall internet culture has a movement that pushes people towards this and rationalises it. however, that sympathy is completely outweighed by the fact that the incel ideology is abhorrent. and, most importantly, being lonely/forever alone does not make adopting incel-ism rational. incel culture needs to be countered, not justified.      i, personally, have my own problems with inceltears. i think they sometimes engage in virgin shaming, which shouldn't be the point in what is wrong with incel ideology. and, too often, i think some also engage in a problematic "just world" rhetoric, where the only reason that all incels lack success with women is their misogynist ideology (not to say that that isn't the main factor with incels once they become incels) - which seems to imply that most people who lack romantic or sexual success lack it due to a moral failing. as a romantically and sexually unsuccessful virgin, that doesn't exactly make me feel wonderful.      edit: re-reading this makes me think my shitty punctuation and weird grammar are a moral failing.

Neutral	yeah i'm asexual and i don't really like being told that i'm not apart of the community. we're not straight so technically we are lgbt but a lot of people in the community are toxic about it which makes me really sad. i haven't personally encountered aphobia but i know some people who have so it's a real issue too
Neutral	poor baby didnt get his dopamine release from the orange button
Neutral	the issue is that these online political personalities are being too insular and not reach out to the communities they want to serve. unless you are a big youtuber, you are more than likely a unknown in the real world. they need to use their community building knowledge or lack of and start interacting with people outside of the net.
Neutral	good for you! it's your life, live it the way you want. i hope you have a good, satisfying life!
Neutral	nice score.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i read a couple more of her tweets and yeah she is a world class retard.  she claims measles cured cancer and uses an old cnn headline to prove it but what she didnt realize is that it was a highly concentrated and modified version of the measles vaccine, not just regular ol' measles you can get from the unvaccinated kid down the street
Neutral	she's the bomb.
Neutral	thanks for sharing this.        it's definitely interesting to hear someone else's experience and how it can relate to the tumblr culture.        i think if anything is worth blogging about it, would be something like this that embodies life experience and inner growth.  other "tom boys" of any age looking for guidance might find it to be helpful.
Neutral	nothing to see here, only a secret club that plays with our psychological reality through conscious and subconscious symbolism, having a mass shooter in their full regalia.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	ever think "you know, maybe the bible was onto something when it condemned homosexuals and said dont tolerate them"
Neutral	please don't take reddit seriously. most people here are really toxic and are nothing like how average people are. there's an alien symbol in the top left corner for a reason. people here just have severe anger issues or something...you would've gotten insulted no matter what you said. everyone here gets called those names.      reddit will only make you feel worse. friends in real life will actually care about you. so you should take a break from the internet and go talk to people who actually want you to be happy in life.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	ghanta. mexico is so toxically macho that women have normalised being leered on or being groped because there is no other option. this must be the equivalent of some posh sobo school protesting against gun violence against blacks
IdentityDirectedAbuse	i agree with this one. however they also believe catholic stuff so they are stuck in a shitty situation. i also believe all of america is just as responsible for the satanic cults that controll america.

PersonDirectedAbuse	the op of the thread is a communist web developer (definitely makes a decent living) upset one of their clients didn't like their advice and didn't want to pay for their product....let that sink in.      then again we are talking about someone who uses pretentious terminology like "apologia" because they think it makes them look smart
Neutral	that's fair. part of the problem is that the national media can't be bothered with the expense of *investigative* journalism: the time, the travel, the resources, etc. it's much cheaper to park a few loudmouths behind a desk and have them fire off their opinions, with or without the facts. it's true that there are some smart, capable journalists in the national media, but if they're not given what they need to actually investigate, it's all for naught.
Neutral	mine was a wash.  we lost the writeoffs but gained tax breaks for being a traditional family.           ...which yes, it irks me a little that being a small business is less important than the ability to push out crotchfruit dependents.

Neutral	but stupid, moron, imbecile, idiot are all okay, right? they meant the same thing as retarded, but we still use them today, because there wasn't big pushback against their use and they melded with language. if the same didn't happen with the word, 'retarded,' then i'm pretty sure it wouldn't be offensive in a way that 'stupid' isn't.      thanks to those charities that take donations in order to discourage the use of 'retarded,' it's been given power and maintained popularity. ironic, yet sustainable.
Neutral	and she doesn't fight back.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	as a woman living in our society........ no. people hate women and women's feelings. the reason we punish men who display sadness or insecurity is because we think of those as feminine emotions. you might see women talking about their feelings more in public but that's because men are all emotionally constipated lol.

Neutral	from the link      for a detailed discussion of the statistical mistakes that almost all climate scientists have been making, see my critique of the statistical analyses in the ipcc's 2013 assessment report. the critique concluded that the statistical analyses are seriously incompetent, and further, that no one has yet drawn valid inferences, via statistics, from climatic time series.      my critique was submitted to the uk department of energy and climate change, by lord donoughue. lord donoughue also arranged for a meeting at the department: with the department's under secretary of state and the department's chief scientific adviser, among others. the meeting was held on 9 january 2014.      at the meeting, the chief scientific adviser claimed that there was observational evidence for significant global warming. i claimed that there was no such evidence—as per my critique. the chief scientific adviser maintained his claim, but was unable to present any such evidence at the meeting. he said, though, that he would later send details of such evidence to lord donoughue.      details of such evidence, however, were never sent. thus, the department seemed to effectively acknowledge that my claim was correct: observational evidence does not exist. furthermore, twelve days after the meeting, on 21 january 2014, the under secretary made a statement in parliament on behalf of the uk government. the statement was as follows.      her majesty's government does not rely upon any specific statistical model for the statistical analysis of global temperature time series.      global temperatures, along with many other aspects of the climate system, are analysed using physically-based mathematical models, rather than purely statistical models.  [hl4497]      in plain english, the uk government stopped using or relying on statistical analysis of observational evidence for global warming; instead, the government started relying solely on computer simulations of the climate system. in short, the government effectively accepted the main conclusions of my critique.
Neutral	you can't just go as far as saying korea is rape culture, wtf.. why do you think yg's restaurants are empty? because actual koreans and normal people don't support it. noone does. and that scandal is so much more than seungri and jung and mr kim, literally so many people are involved and they had protection from politicians. koreans don't support this, they are fighting against it, everyone canceled seungri after this.
Neutral	good on you. more people should aspire to be the same.

Neutral	the funny thing is that these people calling for civil war, genocide and such are the ones that want all weapons banned, the military budget reduced to nothing, and for no one to know how to fight.      do they honestly expect to walk down the street pressing the "x" hitting on their game controllers, and everyone they hate is just supposed to magically fall over dead? it's the very people they want to go to war with that have the weapons and training needed to actually win a fight.      usually in a war it's the young and healthy that do the fighting (and killing and dying) because their youth and strength give them an advantage. unless they are stupid and untrained. then the old and feeble (but trained) mow them down like grass.

Neutral	they're right that animals shouldn't be disturbed for entertainment, but he also did so much more than that. and peta is a terrorist organization, they don't even deserve to speak.
Neutral	reading this was not worth it
Neutral	yeah of course, the main game of a video game, is to be fun. if it's difficulty impedes on this then it is deserving of critisicms.      but if the fun of the game is designed around its difficulty, and your ability to triumph despite the difficulty then if you're not having fun, it's probably just because you don't like that type of game.      so while bugsy3d can be critisiced for its difficulty, dark souls can't be.       i disagree that "git gud" is elitism (i mean it is a little elitist) , i think it more or less translates to "okay, so we could tell you the most efficient way to overcome this obstacle, but if we did you wouldn't have fun, because the fun is derived from learning how to overcome the obstacle"

Neutral	absolutely. it is very easy to identify these old guard folks too. they always seem ready to attack other users, start drama, then act like they don't understand why people can't just enjoy the snark. i think these are also the people who freak out the most about "leghumping" when 9 times out of 10 said leghumping was just a snarker who made a observation that wasn't malicious snark. as long as that continues, i agree the drama likely will too.

Neutral	you did not quote me at all in your response. the quote you have now given literally ignores the very next paragraph - which i quoted to you - about 'implication' and 'misinterpretation' on my part, along with 'strong evidence of high failure rates', etc. my op in that thread listed over 20 scientific papers backing up a 99.9% failure rate to even get to clinical trials. again, what agenda are you talking about? a scientific agenda?

PersonDirectedAbuse	fact ( in dwight schrute's voice )      this movie is directed by mira nair...a typical serial intellectual masturbator liberal . she made a movie titled "the reluctant fundamentalist" where it was shown that how a pakistani guy had a mental breakdown after how he was discriminated in us after 9/11. the funny part is that the pakistani guy returns back to pakistan and is a professor of economics now ; where he teaches the children why should we chase the american dream? what about a pakistani dream .... i cringed so hard...

IdentityDirectedAbuse	*** cope warning ***       in 1995. johnny depp was in his probably best movie ever, directed by jim jarmusch, "dead man". true, i watched with other 5 people but still. a year before, he made "ed wood". few years earlier, he made edward scissorhands. he was in the fucking "platoon". after dead man came donnie brasco and fear & loathing.      if you told me then he will get this fucked by a talentless, dime a dozen thot, i'd say you are a fucking moron.      i'm seriously in disbelief that he allowed himself to get to this point.

Neutral	>the man planted a bullet to make it seem like the kids at the school are carrying guns in order to further his political agenda and institute more restrictive rules.      what political agenda is that, exactly?      the title claims "liberal teacher" but there's nothing in the article to back that claim up. even if his political leanings could be proven one way or the other that still doesn't prove it was politically motivated; sounds to me like he's just salty he got canned. but most importantly, even if a political motive could be proven, it's still not a hate crime hoax.
PersonDirectedAbuse	how is it proof of this?  some portion, i think a very large portion, of sargon's fame comes from people who hatewatch him and make response/commentary videos that shit all over him and his arguments.  when you're youtube famous for being a buffoon, then no, you wouldn't expect mainstream political success (although in fairness to sargon, campaigning to brexiteers might be among your best options).  but that is hardly evidence that other, "better" people couldn't launch a grassroots campaign via youtube.
Neutral	ehh don't know about that. the antarctic treaty was signed because no one gave a shit about a freezing cold and inhospitable continent. has an organization taken advantage of the isolation and lack of persons in the area to build a base or something? maybe, but i don't see antarctica as being the site of some big conspiracy. at best it's the location of some military bases testing bleeding edge tech.

Slur	i'm the last person to come on here and write a long winded post, but obviously i'm at my final straw. next year i'll be 30 years old and i have absolutely nothing to show for myself. when i was a teenager in college i was hopeful, enthusiastic, and genuinely looking forward to what life had to offer. fast forward to today, and i'm a broken, defeated. pessimistic, negative loser who can do nothing better than hop on reddit and bitch about my pathetic life. my parents both moved out of the country when i was 20 years old, which forced me to drop out of college mid semester, find a full time job, and find a cheap apartment to live in. i found a job in the special ed field working as a counselor/mentor and luckily found a relatively cheap basement apartment and a roommate to move in with me. fast forward 9 years and 3 different job. i'm still in the same field, although i am getting slightly higher pay (18.50/hr) and have basic health insurance. other than that minimal progression, i haven't done jack shit with myself. i still live in the same basement apartment that i've been at for 9 years, and the scary thing is i don't know what to do to improves my circumstances. i'm not the most motivated person in the world and am pretty introverted to the point where the unknown really scares me. at the end of the work day, i come home and am absolutely wiped. i barely get 2-3 hours of relaxation time before i pass out and get ready for the next day. i've been walking a metaphorical treadmill for years with no goal or purpose set before me. i'm not particularly good at anything except for being a creative mind. i love to draw and to write fiction. i've been working on a novel series with a partner for 2+ years now, but being that our work schedules are so different, we only work on weekends, which will take us forever to get to where we want. i love fantasy, it's the one thing that's kept me sane this whole time. i basically live in a fictional world in my mind. i use tv shows, anime, and books to escape my shitty reality, and i know i should be doing something else instead, but i don't know what. my old friends from high school are mostly all married, have careers, and generally have their lives figured out, but mentally i'm still in the same place i was 10 years ago, still enjoying video games and other irrelevant shit that won't help me move forward. thing is, it scares me how fast life has passed me by. i still talk, act, and feel like i'm 20, but the reality is i'll be turning 30 in a year and i don't even know how the fuck i got here. granted many of my high school friends had opportunities i didn't, but i can't keep using that excuse forever. people start at nothing and eventually move on up in life. why can't i do the same? i had a long phone conversation with my mom today, where she told me i should look into trade school in my area or think about maybe going back to school. thing is, i've been working the last 9 years. my mentality and lifestyle isn't the same it was back then. i'm home now post work and absolutely have no energy to do anything, just the mere thought of going to school right now and doing homework/research papers again... who the fuck has the time and energy for that shit? apparently many people do, but i'm just not one of them. as i mentioned earlier, i am an introvert by nature. i need my 2-3 hours a night to recharge mentally or else i'll be a complete mess the next day at work. it may sound like an excuse, but it's not. true introverts will know exactly what i'm talking about. so to wrap this whole thing up, i'm going on 30 and have absolutely no idea what to do with my life. i think about this every day and am worried for the future. 30 got here so fast, what'll happen once 40 hits? how will i ever be able to retire if i don't have a profession in hand? i don't want to lead this life anymore. i need help, i need a direction, and i need advice. any advice, no matter how harsh is appreciated. i'm real, no need for fluff. if you think, i'm a pathetic loser piece of shit who can't help himself, by all means say so. i can handle it. what do i do to make a better future for myself?

Neutral	well two things:   1) accounting is not maths. not anymore. computers do the book keeping side of things now, which is the raw number crunching. accountants work is interpreting those numbers and making sure they have been recorded correctly      2) simply using maths is not really enough to be considered part of the mathematics branch of stem. at least in my understanding, that is more for people who have math majors specifically, the types who are working out complex theories, using proofs and such, stuff that makes most of us go "wat?" and very little algebra and arithmetic. stuff that helps advance scientific theories, eg calculus was instrumental in helping physics advance, and i would in my opinion consider that to be the minimum to be a part of stem.

Neutral	here is a thought the main premise of cognitive dissonance is the unwillingness to change your thinking and attitudes towards something they have outright rejected, that why they people who display cognitive dissonance will just throw information at the subject left and right even if its a contradiction to the whole thought aspect as to what they have in mind. i see it all the time so i would just let it be don't sweat the small typos its a keyboard after all not everyone is proficient at typing and some people have handicaps in life that can impact their ability to function on a keyboard. the keyboard is not made for everyone to use that much should be obvious for any person to see especially if they are sincere with their thoughts about certain aspects of life, that is why i say rise above the mental discrimination, its a luxury to have people to spell correctly and is not a requirement unless your here to judge or getting paid.

"the way law enforcement authorities initially investigated this matter as a hate crime i believe was warranted, considering the past and the history."*      so what exactly does investigating it as a hate crime vs investigating it as a crime change in the investigative procedures exactly? that they only look at white people as suspects?      also,   >*had been elected months earlier on a platform of seeking racial unity*      so why jump to the "this must be a hate crime!!" narrative right off the bat if his platform was racial unity?

IdentityDirectedAbuse	the disconnect between what women say they want and what they actually do want reflects the principle of "alpha fux beta bux" at not just a microscopic scale, but also a macroscopic scale.      at a microscopic level: the individual woman takes sheryl sandberg's advice, fucks around with a long procession of different guys, then settles down with the stable provider she'd denied her attention in her youth. this may or may not include her bringing kids from a previous relationship (with some chad) into marriage with this provider. and this may or may not include smoldering resentment that she couldn't rope chad into marrying her, and thus cheating and/or divorce with alimony/child support from our dumb provider.      at a macroscopic level, though: "alpha fux beta bux" closely resembles the dysgenics explored in the movie *idiocracy.* it's a known statistical trend that fertility is inversely correlated with income and education: men and women are too busy "focusing on their careers" to fug, make babby, and leave behind the next generation. the shekels that get skimmed off their paychecks fund food stamps and section 8; the additional sales tax coin charged for their "furbabies'" sweaters fund welfare for single moms; the property tax money applied to their trendy but ever more cramped apartments or condos funds classes for the children of illegal immigrants and trailer trash. all this takes place via a combination of consumerist ideology (think about your next vacation to europe or your next car loan, not about how your neighborhood is getting worse), media domination (movies where men "man up" by subsidizing the mistakes of others; say something too out of line with this status quo, get mobbed by blue checkmarks and terminated from your job), and school indoctrination (do you think that unionized public school teachers, with skin in the game, will legitimately present the cons of property taxes or the ever-increasing numbers of daca or anchor baby students?)      just as individual women expect the future presence of dependable betas who never realize "it is better to be alone, than in bad company," the world increasingly demands the subservience of societal beta providers who never ask questions like "what am i really getting out of my taxes? when did i ever get a say in the changes happening around me? who is really benefiting from these changes?"
Neutral	update numbers on minecraft are so annoying!
Neutral	fair enough.  i didn't know the other sub had been made and, as stated, had been off the thread dealing with other things for several days (which i made the other mods aware of).  i made the post i made because i came back online to see just masses of reports by people who were reporting leg humping like they were trying to keep up with michelle's birthrate. my post was in response to that.  it's silly, to me, to get bent over someone saying, "if you don't want to read leg humping or, alternately, if the harsh shit pisses you off, be your own mod and mute the person who you just reported."  sadly, many took that to be supportive of whatever side they weren't on, rather than taking a moment to understand that, as a fully functioning adult, they could solve their own problem.  i do agree that certain people were gunning to start drama and that that's what happened...but, it apparently started days before my post, but i was a convenient doormat.

Neutral	i actually think choji and karui have one of the more believable relationships, in boruto at least. even if they definitely feel thrown together. plus cho-cho is easily one of the best characters in boruto, too.      but the real issue with shippuden is when you have to write 900 chapters of manga on a weekly schedule, hich is insane, you're gonna fall prey to the same power level escalation, the same xanatos roulettes, the same outta nowhere character pairings and the same ott bullshit that every long running weekly shonen battle manga does.      but yeah, naruto massively undercuts its theme of hard work overcoming natural talent.

Neutral	it's so inconsistent in terms of power levels and i really dislike the art design change from kishimoto. i hate that they're keeping up huge threat levels when boruto doesn't stack up so we spent three months with him watching his dad fight (and no matter what you think of naruto's showing in that last fight, the fight itself was too long). in fact the action in the fights are extremely boring compared to how kishimoto would draw his fights. kishimoto is a master class in manga fight choreography.      ultimately it feels like it's a bad parody of what naruto was. there are good arcs, especially when boruto has to protect the kid. it shows that with lower stakes it would give boruto room to grow but they are pushing this whole karma business that really falls flat.

Neutral	this may be too strong of an emotional response for something like this, but it's a huge pet peeve of mine. keep your filthy hands out of my product; theres a scoop right there if you want to sample something! the store owner doesnt want anyone to sample anything, but i don't care: people will do it anyway and if they feel they can't they'll do it on the sly with their bare hands (more than they do now).      i mean, you people realize that others are going to buy this stuff too right? would you really want to buy some candy or mixed nuts that you knew people had been touching all day? no you wouldn't because thats fucking gross, unsanitary, and slightly nauseating. i used to care enough to stop people, but i quickly learned (on my first day) that if i dropped what i was doing to stop folks from sticking their hands in my product i would never get any work done. it's seriously an all day thing and often happens back to back.      shame on you woman who sneezed into her hand and then grabbed some almonds. don't think i didnt see you, guy who wiped his nose on the back of his hand and then later stuck it in multiple bins. don't even get me started on all the bad parents who don't keep an eye on their kids who then run around my department and end up plunging their hands (sometimes entire arms) into the candy.      while i'm here complaining: screw you people that have mixed up multiple nuts together in a large bag and then attempt to fool the cashier into thinking they are all the same price. we are not stupid and now i have to spend the next hour separating all the nuts one by one so i can put them back. or the people who fill up bags, change their minds (while eating from the bag), and then stuff the entire thing into a random bin because you know i'll put it back properly.      also, fuck your cherry pits, gum, pistachio shells and whatever else you have stuck into your mouths and spit on my floor without any consideration of the fact that a human being has to pick these things up i do not want to touch whatever had been in your dirty ass mouth gloves or not. fuck.      animals, the lot of them.

Neutral	i would consider myself part of the sex-positivity camp, and yeah, mocking someone for being a virgin is just as pointless as mocking someone for being a slut. sex positivity is about supporting people's choices, whether that's lots of sex or none. plus like, young people shouldn't feel pressured to be sexually active before they're ready, and i strongly think that's part of sex positivity. and lastly, mocking someone because they can't get laid/haven't gotten laid is really dehumanizing, it's saying that they're not worthwhile based on their sex life. as a sex-positive person, i think you should call that stuff out when you see it.

IdentityDirectedAbuse	i agree that the joke is harmless, if completely played out and a little insensitive but man, just because it doesn't offend *you* and you've seen worse doesn't mean that nobody will be upset by it. pregnancy is an extremely emotional and sensitive topic for some women who have had miscarriages or are infertile and i think it's totally reasonable for them to be upset at something like this.      it's good to have a thick skin, but it's not good to discount the emotions of others, or to think you speak for them just because you happen to share a circumstance. besides, the "april fool's pregnancy" joke isn't funny, clever, or original. frankly, it isn't good enough of a joke to warrant its potential upsetting effect on other people.      edit: this just in, empathy is unpopular! wammen and their feefees, amirite?

Neutral	fear. fear mongering. fear, fear and fear.       the wall will give some folks a sense of security that doesn't currently exist in their world.       i think a lot of people feel like there is a major change coming in the world and building a fortress is just how you start to protect yourself.      what is this change? maybe it's just a subconscious feeling, like when you know a storm is coming. or maybe it's a feeling in the air. i think we all agree that the planet is doing some crazy shit, we just dont agree with what it is, what is causing it or what the final outcome will be.      the wall is just a small thing that they can do, to make them feel like they are preparing.

Neutral	this reminds me of this ***one*** cyclist i saw ***once***. it was at a 3-way intersection and there were no bike paths. this cyclist crossed the road at the pedestrian lights to an island a bike's length away from the footpath. for some reason i cannot fathom, this cyclist decided not to cross this very short distance and instead rode his bike for about 50 metres into oncoming traffic (the only side of the three with a green light) before riding diagonally to the footpath. the same footpath that was about a metre from the island he was at.             i've seen thousands of cyclists in my area, even teenagers, who ride safely. just last week i watched two teenagers on bikes cross the road when the pedestrian light was green and causing absolutely no threat to themselves or others.             if the police are going to punish any cyclist it should be the ones who are obviously riding dangerously and unfortunately, it's these ones who ***never see any repercussions for their obviously dangerous behaviour.*** worse still, it is people like the one cyclist who ignores the rules that ruin it for everyone else and just encourage the hatred that drivers and pedestrians have for cyclists.             edit: this is the incident i'm describing      footpath..............................................pedestrian light      ----------------------------------------------------------------|      <- direction of the road....................................|      ----------------------------------------------------------------(little island)      ->direction of the road  ^-<-<-<-<-<- <-cyclist |^      ----------------------------------------------------------------|^      ->direction of the road.....................................|^      ----------------------------------------------------------------|cyclist      footpath..............................................pedestrian light

Neutral	the great part of this is you literally cannot understand physics without math, like at all. to understand requires a language in which to express that understanding, and for physics the only language which can do this is mathematics. i'm betting his "understanding" is a collection of incoherent pop sci articles about quantum mechanics.
Neutral	a google engineer named james damore sent out an internal memo (prompted by recent diversity training at the company) talking about how (iirc) diversity hiring wasn't helping google, and that they'd never have as many women as men at the company because women's interests simply differ from men's. he never said "all women" or that women are bad engineers, he just said that not as many women are interested in sitting at a computer doing technical mathy shit all day. he got fired.

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	it fundamentally places blame on others for their celibacy.       let me ask, why are you so determined to reclaim this label? why not just involve yourself in communities that give advice on dating and sex for inexperienced people, without the weird, unnecessary, violent baggage from that word ? it seems steeping stone-y to me, idk. you know, get frustrated, yet reasonable people on board. that frustration is bound to turn to anger, right . at least for a few?      this relatively new, fringe internet movement has already two shootings, with a community to cheer them on and muddy the waters for good measure. and god knows how many more on the way. enough is enough       you can have a tough time with sex and the opposite gender without putting such a label on yourself. god knows i do. but, it's super insensitive to all the lives 'incels' have taken. it's not a label worth reclaiming for whatever 'good' people there are that want to make a personal identity about not getting laid

Neutral	i've always tried hard in things. in school, i studied every day and got good grades, tried to do volunteering, did student council and stuff, and did my best to be a generally nice person. but somehow, my friend was always better. she got similar grades without trying. she applied to the same scholarships that i did and got them all while i never got a single reply. everyone seems to like her. i notice that whenever we are in a conversation with someone else, they look at her and only glance at me occasionally (i know, this is not something regular people would notice). she is even better than me in a completely luck based phone game we play. i lose in every area of life. i know comparing myself to her this way is unhealthy and self-destructive, and that i should focus on improving myself instead. but i can't stop. i've started to resent her for always having it easier than me. now, on top of everything else, i feel like she's a better person than me for not hating her best friend.       i doubt anyone will care about this, but i just really wanted to get this off my chest after so long.

Neutral	> when most males are pressured to become doctors or emts over nurses, which is still viewed as a feminine career overall by quite a lot of people, the field being 91% women doesn't really mean anything to me.      yeah... a situation where most nurses are women and most doctors are men doesn't quite seem like a shining example of gender equality.

Neutral	i used to cry all the time as a child and told adults how i used to be treated at home . they chalked it up to me being a sensitive kid and one teacher even went as far as calling me a cry baby in second grade and refusing to speak to me until she absolutely had to.       home was hell, i was called useless , fat , dumb , and everything in between. i'm held back a year because they didn't bother putting me in school when i should have been and i'm just so pissed that i could be graduating this year but i'm not!       this past year i was kicked out of the house so i stayed with a friend. two weeks in my friend's mom suggested i try to make bite the bullet and go home because "you've always been a sensitive kid" . really ? go back to an abusive place , because you perceive me as sensitive ???       there's a reason i cried almost every day. i don't anymore , because i'm not around them. don't just brush off a child when they react negatively to something , real things might be happening to them but you wan to take the easy way out and label them as sensitive. i will never forget the teachers and parents who played dumb when it came to how my home like was. i will never forgive them either .

AffiliationDirectedAbuse	you know what? when that crazy trump supporter was sending pipe bombs to a bunch of leftist icons, i didn't see any conservatives responding to that by saying "well, don't forget all of the violent things that antifa does."      it's not because the two things are beyond comparison. it's because in tragic situations like that, conservatives are generally able to restrain themselves from resorting to "whataboutism" and trying to redirect the public focus to other things that fit a narrative. you just don't see that kind of restraint as often on the left.       even when antifa does things that are undoubtedly horrible and can't possibly be justified or defended, then if nothing else the left will try to shift the focus away and demand that people remember all the bad things that right-wing extremists have done instead.

Neutral	i legit read that sub like it's a mixture of 14 year olds who've worked themselves up into an ignorance-fueled hysteria and 30 year olds dressed like 14 year olds, trying to whip them up into an even bigger hysteria.
Neutral	there was absolutely no correlation between those too.
Neutral	last time i check guatamalans and hondurans aren't persecuted ethno-religious minorities in their country of origin and are facing extermination by their government.
Neutral	papers are in the brain zapping wikis in [USER]:       [URL]
Neutral	[serious]      # who is this?
Neutral	one of the foundational principles of chinese is to never use a phrase when a euphemism will suffice.      china has such a profound culture, do you know it?
Neutral	fuck reddit. this fucking site deserves to die.      anyone sick of it too can come to saidit.
Neutral	yes, if it means it will swap over into other fields.
Neutral	lmao she got a big ass head
Neutral	this, but unironically
Neutral	carl is not traveling anymore as he was brutally shot to death by police when crossing the border of israel
Neutral	no. these are the same morons who think men's razors aren't taxed.
Neutral	that being said the church at the moment is anglican but because of the kings and queens all having different interpretations on religions during their reigns it has never consistently been anglican.      during edward vi's reign it was most indefinitely protestant
Neutral	yea i think you're right, i highly doubt it was intended to be an april fools joke.
Neutral	it's a joke buddy, it's all good
Neutral	not logically feasible. tournaments can be huge with hundreds of games going on simultaneously. you *could* limit it to the top tables where the feature matches are ongoing, but eh then what's the point. even in that case, there isn't enough money in the game to afford such personnel. also, a lot of players are very possessive about their cards, which have real monetary value. risking rough treatment in the hands of another gets some people really hot and heated.
Neutral	this guy sucks at china
IdentityDirectedAbuse	>trying to imply rinos are conservative.      oof, the smooth brains.
Neutral	i wouldn't worry about this too much.  i take most things people say on reddit with salt mines.  out of all the things i do, the things i've seen, and the people i've interacted with in real life, 99.95% of the time it had nothing to do with politics.  there was one time when a liberal friend of a friend started cracking jokes about trump when we were all playing drinking games.  everyone laughed, no one took it seriously, the night went on without anymore politics.      intentional or not, reddit makes things seem like they are as big in the real world as they are online.  every time i have my doubts and think "man do a lot of people think like this?", i look back at my day-to-day life and realize that it's not even close to representation.
Neutral	i swear this is a poe but given what i've seen? i don't know anymore.
Neutral	ever subreddit needs a meme every once and a while
Neutral	deus vult
Neutral	> can all these fucking wannabe scientists that can't be bothered to actually learn some maths      hey man, biologists are people too
Neutral	conversion therapy for straight guys now!
Neutral	he only married her so he can oppress her!
Neutral	watch rick and morty
Neutral	just because reddit loves him that doesn't make him unfunny.
Neutral	that's reddit as a whole banning you for a set period of time
Neutral	the ones with the biggest victim complex are people like this who whine about how opressed they are.      you live in a first world county, for gods sake.
Neutral	i'm a libertarian and the socially right smuggies that i see here are awful but i acknowledge i sure couldn't make anything better
Neutral	holy shit rekt!
Neutral	it was always their only mo
Neutral	oh man, this guy feels like the last novelty account here. this one seems alright but i completely get why people would ban him. when they were *the thing* it got annoying as shit, especially guys like potato_in_my_anus (his meltdown was kino tho)      they were all annoying.      except for _vargas.
Neutral	they are not even giving reasons when i asked them. i dont think this is hate speech. this was just an opinion.
Neutral	i think i really needed to vent this out and forgive me for it being so long.      in late january, my dad had a massive heart attack and almost died before his 50th birthday. he had 3 clogged arteries, 100%, 85% and another 70 ish %. my heart was so fucking crushed when i saw him the icu, all pale, ivs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. that week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.       all in the months of may and june; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in july.      i had to re-home my lizard because i am moving and she means literally so much to me. i fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me.      i got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and i honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me.      my therapist from since i was 2 years old, has cancer. it rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance.      during this entire year, i think i've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. i want to get help, but i also don't want to necessarily stop altogether.      so basically that was my year (so far). i have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. i mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (the most being my father's near death experience).      thank you for reading and i hope you can have a wonderful rest of 2019
PersonDirectedAbuse	you're a dumb herbsing hurt
Neutral	the left can't meme, but the right can't code.
Neutral	you're a big fish.
Neutral	and apparently he's a good guy.
Neutral	even walking every day, i've learned to never cross in front of a prius or a black jeep.
Neutral	this astroturfing got out of hand a long time ago. establishment democrats will probably chew her up in not too long and we'll never hear about her again.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	who in their right mind would come out as a liberal in paki fucking stan. they'll get 'liberated'.
Neutral	you couldn't really declare a private matter as a "national" emergency though, a border wall seems to fit more in the national emergency category even if you dont agree that it is one.
Neutral	black male/white female pairings are fairly rare. it's a media fetish of nyc liberal women, but it's not much of a reality.
Neutral	thank you, i'm sorry that happened to you. i'm working on it.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	[playing anything other than stellaris](gt)      soyed and cuckpilled
Neutral	locally, temporarily, yes
Neutral	it was tweeted by a white woman.
Neutral	archive is your friend.
Neutral	nobody with a right mind should care about '[job/field] is dominated by men'. it has nothing to with gender, it's about the he performance of the individuals. if a man does it better than a woman it's obvious to go for the man, if a women does it better pick the woman. not that hard
Neutral	periodic reminder that the moderators of [USER] engage in politically biased moderation practices and routinely permanently ban users even when they broke no rules whatsoever because they don't approve of their political or religious views      while [USER] should, in theory, be a nonpartisan and nonpolitical subreddit, it is in fact run by leftist moderators who ban anyone who they consider a "bigot" (aka anyone who is even slightly right of them on the political spectrum). for example, if you post a question in [USER] asking how to remove the gay propaganda icon they force down your throat during gay pride month, they will instantly ban you despite the fact that there is nothing bigoted or rule breaking about asking that question and it is in fact a legitimate question      evidently, the moderators of [USER] are very strongly against anyone who they consider to be "unaccepting of lgbt people" - even if you're not actually unaccepting of them, but openly hate socially conservative/religious people and consider us "bigots" for following the tenets of our faith and asking how to remove content we find offensive from our reddit page layout
Neutral	moms gonna freak
Neutral	oh i thought you were the guy censored.
Neutral	27 points between white and person of colour. 5 points between rich and poor. whatever they're smoking, i want some.
Neutral	ofc it is, it's been going on for years now and nothing has come of it.
Neutral	see, i'm okay with type 1 people because they just kinda rp in their subculture all nice and quiet, but every other type is just showing the majority of them is trying very desperately to fit in on tumblr, like being an emo goth hippie juggalo skater.
IdentityDirectedAbuse	i haven't found any. i take some and leave some, practicing what i call "mental discernment" where ideally the untruth is perceived for what it is. it is a difficult ability to cultivate, but one well worth acquiring, since nobody seems to be telling the whole story.      there would be my own videos, but they are not in english and "only" pertain to life and mind. which are, if you really consider the question honestly, the only things we actually have.      in other words, my view is we should make our lives great, make them matter, and for that we need access to certain states, and worrying about what (((they))) might be doing is utterly counterproductive. it is still interesting to consider these things, but avoiding fascination or worry, instead focusing on bettering one's life.
Neutral	if you can't go out without being emotionally supported, just stay in, because he world is much harder than that.
Neutral	chest pain is fairly common, sadly rarely a heart attack.
Neutral	he's high on pot noose
Neutral	finally some robust research into whether "diversity training" actually works – unfortunately it's not very promising

IdentityDirectedAbuse	>slugger      why are you afraid of saying "retard"     
Neutral	he did when he questioned kavanaugh when all the rape threats were thrown left and right.  
Neutral	guy here. majority of guys are not into that and don't do anything you aren't comfortable with.
Neutral	i used to be depressed. for about 10 years, after dropping out of college. about 5 months ago after spreading myself incredibly thin trying to solve everyone else's problems in my clan, i meet someone who seems to just click with me.      no name but a letter. anime pic. everything should have told me this is a catfish.      but i was so fucking lonely.      it comes to be this person happens to be extremely rich on runescape, and offered to give me 20 bonds for gold premier.      the catch? i had to give them the 7 bonds i had already, because "it'll be a better gift if i give you all 20!"      of course i do so without thinking.      trade complete.      b has left the clan. b has logged off.      i'm just sitting there staring at those words on my screen.      this must be a prank, right? no one would do that, be nice to someone then backstab them as soon as they get something, right?      10 minutes pass. i haven't moved. one of my friends pm's me "why are you on that world?"      all i could manage to say was "i don't know."      i'd just gotten scammed because i was thinking with my dick.      i can't show my face to my clan anymore. they'll never let me live it down. i can't handle that. i'm supposed to be the clan mediator who helps everyone resolve issues. not the completely broken mask that it actually is.      so i left. never logged in again. on anything. totally off the grid save my job.      a month goes by. my phone blares notifications at me... "naive we miss you." "naive, hope you're okay." "naive what happened?" "naive we're really worried."      lies. all lies.      about a month and a half ago, i finally summon the energy to go to the doctor. i just tell her right out i'm depressed. she prescribes me 200mg bupropion, twice daily.      so now i'm on medication for depression. doesn't feel like anything.      until 3 weeks ago.      all of a sudden, i'm a completely different man. garulous, entertaining, genuinely fun to talk to. came back to my clan ecstatic. things are looking good for once.      except when you didn't agree with me.      then i was the absolute hugest asshole in existence. because how dare someone try to harsh my happiness?      so i treat them like i would any other asshole. i mocked them. i poked fun at all the words they say. and when they inevitably fight back, i get underhanded. start slinging shit that was told to me in confidence.      of course they respond in kind. and then i played the victim. dissected their words and arguments, completely contradicting myself at times just to win the argument.      oh i won the arguments. but now the entire clan hates me. they don't even acknowledge me when i speak in the clan.      i've become *that* guy. the one you have to tip toe around on eggshells because he might snap and bite your head off.      i've become the crazy one.      i'm not fixed. sure i'm no longer depressed.      but i've never felt more isolated than i do in this very moment.      they just wrote me off. i can't blame them. no one wants to deal with someone whose perception of reality is this fucked.      no one wants to hear out why i'm saying the things i say. no one is acknowledging that i said i need another break from discord. no one cares.      so i left. again.      i shouldn't be around people. i'm trash. filth. the worst kind of asshole, the one that *has* to be right.      don't end up like me. if you were depressed and now feel almost insanely good, see your doctor.      don't be the reason your friends give up on you. you'll regret it so much, like i am now.
Neutral	orthodox-let gets btfo.
Neutral	my left nostril has a hair that i'd usually pull out, but just letting it be and enjoying it.
Neutral	hunting is fun
Neutral	what you said made me feel warmth in my heart and sadness on the same time. have you by any chance heard the term "highly sensitive person"? we (i am one as well) are a real thing, it's determined by your nervous system, which in hsps is more developed than average. almost 20% of people are hsp's and also there happen to be highly sensitive ones among animals. it serves a purpose, because they are more sensitive not only emotionally, but also sensually, so they are more likely to notice if something is wrong. highly sensitive animals are the guards because of that. it used be so with humans before we could depend on technology to be safe and sound. anyway, i consider high sensibility as some super power and with great power comes great responsibility.   i'm not implying that you are hsp, but doing some research on that topic might be really helpful, because hsps and ausies share a lot in characteristics. i hope i helped at least a little
AffiliationDirectedAbuse	i never admit to anyone in real life i use reddit. it's embarrassing and makes you immediately uncool and seem like some fringe leftist.
Neutral	savage . i love it .  keep up the good work!
Neutral	nice comeback lol
Neutral	but all cops hate black people so if you don't hate cops then you must also hate black people         /s
Neutral	note the context.       i'm replying to a person who believes that      "mra's are a male supremacist movement that try to appropriate menslib to give their reactionary movement legitimacy."
Neutral	and everyone clapped. no one would withdraw from law school without a transfer in place. also finals aren't until next month. you also don't do it with an email.
Neutral	r/the_donald bans me for "cherrypicking" - even though cherrypicking isn't prohibited in their rulebook
Neutral	well no most sexual assaults are done by someone you know not just random men you invite over and hopefully a child you bear from pregnancy to adult hood if you have a son and he's sexually assaulting your daughter its probably because you lack the maturity to raise kids properly and your children have grown up without morals..       and the fact you're actively trying to keep people away leads me to suspect you might not be all that honest in your intentions anyways. not even just the indoctrination. but i feel like this person is probably scared to have a non"feminist" or at least people from outside their typical social circle because they probably have something to hide and the police should look into this. because the author already comes across as severly mentally ill and i don't think a child should be left in the care of a single "feminist" mother with an agenda whos probably suffering from serious issues.
Neutral	lol the obama one sounds like he's got a mouth full of marbles
