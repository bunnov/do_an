0	it's so inconsistent in terms of power levels and i really dislike the art design change from kishimoto. i hate that they're keeping up huge threat levels when boruto doesn't stack up so we spent three months with him watching his dad fight (and no matter what you think of naruto's showing in that last fight, the fight itself was too long). in fact the action in the fights are extremely boring compared to how kishimoto would draw his fights. kishimoto is a master class in manga fight choreography.      ultimately it feels like it's a bad parody of what naruto was. there are good arcs, especially when boruto has to protect the kid. it shows that with lower stakes it would give boruto room to grow but they are pushing this whole karma business that really falls flat.

0	well no most sexual assaults are done by someone you know not just random men you invite over and hopefully a child you bear from pregnancy to adult hood if you have a son and he's sexually assaulting your daughter its probably because you lack the maturity to raise kids properly and your children have grown up without morals..       and the fact you're actively trying to keep people away leads me to suspect you might not be all that honest in your intentions anyways. not even just the indoctrination. but i feel like this person is probably scared to have a non"feminist" or at least people from outside their typical social circle because they probably have something to hide and the police should look into this. because the author already comes across as severly mentally ill and i don't think a child should be left in the care of a single "feminist" mother with an agenda whos probably suffering from serious issues.

0	exactly, subscribing to an incel ideology is not an acceptable response to being lonely/forever alone - and a fair amount of those alone people are women so good luck getting many of them to subscribe to incel culture. it's fine to feel sympathy for people who are lonely, but that should not make it somehow understandable that they turn to an ideology of such bitter hatred towards women. and not just hatred in the abstract but sometimes with calls to violence towards women, a lamenting of rights granted to women and theorising about systems which would rob women of their sexual autonomy - if not more.      the sympathetic portrayal of the movement by some and, indeed, the movement itself is part of a wider spread of white cishet male identity politics. it is quite obvious that there is a large segment of the internet that revels in misfortune happening to people who aren't in the in-group (white cishet men). this group is a spectrum of people from those who think feminists are crazy all the way to people so radical that they will commit real-world acts of violence. the more general groups (which you can see on subreddits like justiceserved and the now-defunct cringe anarchy) react with sympathy towards people within the in-group and the opposite to "the other". and this movement is also a spectrum in what they focus on - some focus on the racial aspect, some focus on that of gender and some focus on sexuality - though they often share the views of the other groups and the overall theme is being reactionary towards threats to the privilege of white cishet men.      in my view, incel-ism is a facet of this aspect of internet culture, with men becoming the focused in-group and women becoming the other. and, because of this, the more moderate section of this trend of identity politics will feel sympathy to them because of what they perceive as slights by society against men as a whole and they don't want to sound like a "crazy feminist". though, by this point, incel ideology has become so famously toxic that much of the "centrist" h3h3/rogan crowd will - rightly -  throw them under the bus.      so, i do feel sympathy for the lonely part of their existence and it is sad that they can so easily become caught up in such a toxic ideology and it is devious how overall internet culture has a movement that pushes people towards this and rationalises it. however, that sympathy is completely outweighed by the fact that the incel ideology is abhorrent. and, most importantly, being lonely/forever alone does not make adopting incel-ism rational. incel culture needs to be countered, not justified.      i, personally, have my own problems with inceltears. i think they sometimes engage in virgin shaming, which shouldn't be the point in what is wrong with incel ideology. and, too often, i think some also engage in a problematic "just world" rhetoric, where the only reason that all incels lack success with women is their misogynist ideology (not to say that that isn't the main factor with incels once they become incels) - which seems to imply that most people who lack romantic or sexual success lack it due to a moral failing. as a romantically and sexually unsuccessful virgin, that doesn't exactly make me feel wonderful.      edit: re-reading this makes me think my shitty punctuation and weird grammar are a moral failing.

0	it is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both. cao cao's character is greatly informed by his orders and actions, alternately being merciful or merciless, generous or greedy, piously adoring or rebelliously denouncing his superiors as is most expedient in the shrewdness of the moment. he simply has no underlying morality, though this is not unique among the novel's main characters. what may make cao so infamous is not only how successful this made him, but also that he made fewer oblations to filial piety part of his core public identity. his greatest rivals, the suns and wu, the yuans, shu, all make high profile acts of familial devotion and their close relationships (also often quite shrewd) pr talking points everywhere, cao cao does not bother except as necessary and expedient.       for example, shu plays a constant shell game of political heat between the oath brothers and they become masters at it. the most notable time cao does something similar is at the very end of his life, where he orchestrates a quick shuffle with his son where cao cao formally deposes the emperor and installs cao pi shortly before his death, then the new emperor posthumously pardons and recognizes his father as the actual first emperor of their dynasty.

0	this is completely misplaced.      people aren't celebrating steam's monopoly on the market. people are complaining that *publishers themselves* are forcing consumers' hands by setting up their own stores. apart from the fact that a lot of people just don't like the idea of giving certain publishers a bigger cut than they already receive, you need to consider that, paradoxically, this type of competition is actually anti-consumer.      it's anti-consumer because, when these titles compete on steam, they compete more directly. consumers have more alternatives: if i don't like one publisher's product, there's another publisher's product just a few clicks away. often the two are competing right next to each other. that means games need to compete with each other on quality and on price.      when every aaa publisher owns their own storefront which exclusively sells their titles, they don't face such direct competition, and can conduct themselves accordingly: indeed, this is often their express intent in setting up their own storefronts. fewer discounts, less scrutiny, more control over fan reactions, higher margins.      if you don't like steam's monopolization of the market, you need to outline the alternative program, not just cheer as publishers carve it up and leave consumers behind.

0	antinatalism is not a strong position imo, but you're making bad arguments against it      > if you are alive, you can enjoy a delicious slice of pizza. therefore by your logic, i have found one reason to exist, ergo the only possible conclusion is that you should have children.      by whose logic? i've never heard an antinatalist argue that there are literally no positives to being alive. their arguments usually fall into these categories:      - the challenges or bad parts of life do outweigh the good      - even if they don't, it's difficult to prove it convincingly enough to justify action (creating a life and rolling the dice) vs inaction (not creating a life, neutral result)      - even if you prove the utilitarian case convincingly enough, you've argued yourself into a moral imperative to have literally as many children as possible      if you're like the overwhelming majority of people, being alive is obviously better than not being alive, and it's absurd to question it. but it's not the case for everyone. imagine if your experience of life (the only experience you truly have access to) were overwhelmingly negative, and you genuinely would have preferred to have never been born. can you see how the decision to create another life would seem morally ambiguous from that perspective?

0	fear. fear mongering. fear, fear and fear.       the wall will give some folks a sense of security that doesn't currently exist in their world.       i think a lot of people feel like there is a major change coming in the world and building a fortress is just how you start to protect yourself.      what is this change? maybe it's just a subconscious feeling, like when you know a storm is coming. or maybe it's a feeling in the air. i think we all agree that the planet is doing some crazy shit, we just dont agree with what it is, what is causing it or what the final outcome will be.      the wall is just a small thing that they can do, to make them feel like they are preparing.

0	well no most sexual assaults are done by someone you know not just random men you invite over and hopefully a child you bear from pregnancy to adult hood if you have a son and he's sexually assaulting your daughter its probably because you lack the maturity to raise kids properly and your children have grown up without morals..       and the fact you're actively trying to keep people away leads me to suspect you might not be all that honest in your intentions anyways. not even just the indoctrination. but i feel like this person is probably scared to have a non"feminist" or at least people from outside their typical social circle because they probably have something to hide and the police should look into this. because the author already comes across as severly mentally ill and i don't think a child should be left in the care of a single "feminist" mother with an agenda whos probably suffering from serious issues.

1	i agree that the joke is harmless, if completely played out and a little insensitive but man, just because it doesn't offend *you* and you've seen worse doesn't mean that nobody will be upset by it. pregnancy is an extremely emotional and sensitive topic for some women who have had miscarriages or are infertile and i think it's totally reasonable for them to be upset at something like this.      it's good to have a thick skin, but it's not good to discount the emotions of others, or to think you speak for them just because you happen to share a circumstance. besides, the "april fool's pregnancy" joke isn't funny, clever, or original. frankly, it isn't good enough of a joke to warrant its potential upsetting effect on other people.      edit: this just in, empathy is unpopular! wammen and their feefees, amirite?

0	exactly, subscribing to an incel ideology is not an acceptable response to being lonely/forever alone - and a fair amount of those alone people are women so good luck getting many of them to subscribe to incel culture. it's fine to feel sympathy for people who are lonely, but that should not make it somehow understandable that they turn to an ideology of such bitter hatred towards women. and not just hatred in the abstract but sometimes with calls to violence towards women, a lamenting of rights granted to women and theorising about systems which would rob women of their sexual autonomy - if not more.      the sympathetic portrayal of the movement by some and, indeed, the movement itself is part of a wider spread of white cishet male identity politics. it is quite obvious that there is a large segment of the internet that revels in misfortune happening to people who aren't in the in-group (white cishet men). this group is a spectrum of people from those who think feminists are crazy all the way to people so radical that they will commit real-world acts of violence. the more general groups (which you can see on subreddits like justiceserved and the now-defunct cringe anarchy) react with sympathy towards people within the in-group and the opposite to "the other". and this movement is also a spectrum in what they focus on - some focus on the racial aspect, some focus on that of gender and some focus on sexuality - though they often share the views of the other groups and the overall theme is being reactionary towards threats to the privilege of white cishet men.      in my view, incel-ism is a facet of this aspect of internet culture, with men becoming the focused in-group and women becoming the other. and, because of this, the more moderate section of this trend of identity politics will feel sympathy to them because of what they perceive as slights by society against men as a whole and they don't want to sound like a "crazy feminist". though, by this point, incel ideology has become so famously toxic that much of the "centrist" h3h3/rogan crowd will - rightly -  throw them under the bus.      so, i do feel sympathy for the lonely part of their existence and it is sad that they can so easily become caught up in such a toxic ideology and it is devious how overall internet culture has a movement that pushes people towards this and rationalises it. however, that sympathy is completely outweighed by the fact that the incel ideology is abhorrent. and, most importantly, being lonely/forever alone does not make adopting incel-ism rational. incel culture needs to be countered, not justified.      i, personally, have my own problems with inceltears. i think they sometimes engage in virgin shaming, which shouldn't be the point in what is wrong with incel ideology. and, too often, i think some also engage in a problematic "just world" rhetoric, where the only reason that all incels lack success with women is their misogynist ideology (not to say that that isn't the main factor with incels once they become incels) - which seems to imply that most people who lack romantic or sexual success lack it due to a moral failing. as a romantically and sexually unsuccessful virgin, that doesn't exactly make me feel wonderful.      edit: re-reading this makes me think my shitty punctuation and weird grammar are a moral failing.

0	this reminds me of this ***one*** cyclist i saw ***once***. it was at a 3-way intersection and there were no bike paths. this cyclist crossed the road at the pedestrian lights to an island a bike's length away from the footpath. for some reason i cannot fathom, this cyclist decided not to cross this very short distance and instead rode his bike for about 50 metres into oncoming traffic (the only side of the three with a green light) before riding diagonally to the footpath. the same footpath that was about a metre from the island he was at.             i've seen thousands of cyclists in my area, even teenagers, who ride safely. just last week i watched two teenagers on bikes cross the road when the pedestrian light was green and causing absolutely no threat to themselves or others.             if the police are going to punish any cyclist it should be the ones who are obviously riding dangerously and unfortunately, it's these ones who ***never see any repercussions for their obviously dangerous behaviour.*** worse still, it is people like the one cyclist who ignores the rules that ruin it for everyone else and just encourage the hatred that drivers and pedestrians have for cyclists.             edit: this is the incident i'm describing      footpath..............................................pedestrian light      ----------------------------------------------------------------|      <- direction of the road....................................|      ----------------------------------------------------------------(little island)      ->direction of the road  ^-<-<-<-<-<- <-cyclist |^      ----------------------------------------------------------------|^      ->direction of the road.....................................|^      ----------------------------------------------------------------|cyclist      footpath..............................................pedestrian light

0	well almost everyone from those times sucked. i recently went over roman history once more and it was pretty spectacular how much insanity was just glanced over in my school years. like how generals like caesar basically started wars for personal profit and downright genocided major areas. i can't find the exact numbers anymore but i believe the historians' estimates were that around 40% of gauls may have died  in the gallic wars, with entire tribes marked for annihiliation.      the used to be celebrated for introducing culture and democracy into my country, and while teaching did include that things got bloody, it's pretty jarring to see just how much.

0	that's why we should take a step back and let the police handle things.  also, it looks like the cotton affair was eventually resolved by advances in dna testing, which has become pretty standard in those types of investigations.  don't get me wrong, i hate when anyone is unjustly imprisoned.  my hope is that the police and das have come to the consensus that eyewitness accounts are often unreliable, and evidence should be paramount.

0	we're currently living in a material universe in which power trumps all, "good" and "evil" are more or less human perspectives, i think we have been conditioned to believe in some sort of judgment from a higher power but the more i learn about the universe the more i realize that everything comes from balancing a dualistic force and the universe itself seems to be set on neutral, there is no preference for the dark or the light but only cause and effect within its laws of physics. take a lion for an example, if it doesn't eat it will die, so it finds an antelope and devours it for sustenance, from the lions perspective this is good but from the antelopes perspective the lion is evil, in the end the world is naturally designed to favour the more powerful force.      i'm not saying god, hell and judgment don't exist but looking at the natural order of things if there is a god, higher realms and heaven, then it's found beyond the material. here on earth the only thing that matters is power. if you ponder this sort of thing allot i would look into gnosticism, the gnostics believe that the material world was created by a demi god and that's why it's dualistic and imperfect.

0	nature isn't a wonderful, peaceful place, and anyone who thinks it is, is delusional. everything wants to kill you, the elements, other animals, diseases, ect. it doesn't inherently provide for you.       if you walk into a forrest expecting to gather plentiful food and clean water, you will die. the food you will find will taste terrible and take a ton of effort to gather or hunt enough of to actually be nourishing. the water will always be dirty and taste disgusting.      i get the appeal, it's a pretty place to visit. it's easy to embellish the peace and beauty when you don't see predators covered in the blood of their prey, or a rabid animal being painfully reducing to a brain dead mess.      be happy for human advancement. take pride in the machines we've build and the plentiful resources we've made for ourselves because nature doesn't care. it never has, and our advancement as a species has come inspite of nature, not because of it.

0	>*greenville mayor errick d. simmons initially urged officials to investigate the church burning as a possible hate crime. simmons is african-american and had been elected months earlier on a platform of seeking racial unity.*      >*the mayor's twin, democratic state sen. derrick simmons, told ap in december 2016 that his brother had taken the right approach.*      >*"there is a dark past in america and in the deep south regarding the burning of african-american churches," derrick simmons said. "the way law enforcement authorities initially investigated this matter as a hate crime i believe was warranted, considering the past and the history."*      so what exactly does investigating it as a hate crime vs investigating it as a crime change in the investigative procedures exactly? that they only look at white people as suspects?      also,   >*had been elected months earlier on a platform of seeking racial unity*      so why jump to the "this must be a hate crime!!" narrative right off the bat if his platform was racial unity?

0	background: 21 years old, chubby, friendless, haven't kissed a girl or even held her hand yet. i feel like i've missed out on a lot of things i should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up.      every day is as boring as the previous one. if someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face.      it's sad, man. every year i feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. i wish i could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. the list goes on. but sadly, i can't change my past.      what's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. yes, i do have overprotective parents, but i should have done something. if only i had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where i was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time i opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different.      nowadays, i often act against my own interests solely out of fear. for example: some weeks ago, i messaged a girl i had been texting for around a month (i don't know if i like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if i actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since i didn't get an answer half an hour later i decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed.      right after waking up, i saw her reply. she answered 10 minutes after i knocked myself out. said she was at some club and told me to drop by if i wanted. a few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if i wanted to go. and that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour.      what did i do? i saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know i saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why i couldn't answer earlier. even though i really wanted to see her.      my lack of social skills angers me. i know i would've done the exact same thing if i hadn't gone to bed before her reply. why? because i fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). the beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, i'm not happy with my body at all.      it's not that i'm an introvert. socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. it kills me when i find something funny on the internet and i have no one to share it with. or when i want to go to the movies or something and i have no one to go with. i dislike being by myself most of the time. i'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. or even go on vacations with, like some do. but since i tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and i usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. and i'd love to go to nightclubs, but i don't have the social skills to really enjoy it.      i've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. lost 6% bodyfat but i 'gave up' again two weeks ago. i'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. that the door has already closed. the same dumb questions arise: "why would i want to be ripped at 22? will i even be able to catch up with social skills? will it even be worth it?".      any advice is welcome.

0	yeah of course, the main game of a video game, is to be fun. if it's difficulty impedes on this then it is deserving of critisicms.      but if the fun of the game is designed around its difficulty, and your ability to triumph despite the difficulty then if you're not having fun, it's probably just because you don't like that type of game.      so while bugsy3d can be critisiced for its difficulty, dark souls can't be.       i disagree that "git gud" is elitism (i mean it is a little elitist) , i think it more or less translates to "okay, so we could tell you the most efficient way to overcome this obstacle, but if we did you wouldn't have fun, because the fun is derived from learning how to overcome the obstacle"

0	> was i kind to him? well, no.      i'm just wondering what magical words you found to get this type of reaction.  i've gotten more bans than i could even count and have replied with all sorts of insane shit to the modmail.  i think i told one to hurry back to his circlejerk before he missed his cumshower...told another to suck the diarrhea out of my ass with a straw...just whatever craziness happened to pop into my head at the moment that was a bit more creative than telling them to shove their sub up their ass.  but never got suspended.      i guess it depends on what mod it is.
0	tell her. simple as that
0	the same could be said for whenever a big franchise film is breaking records i suppose, but it's always weird how these people talk about it like they have a personal stake in the film's financial success. it's a product manufactured by a giant corporation for a franchise that regularly generates billions of dollars. why is the prospect of it making more money than another multi billion dollar property so exciting?

0	why are you searching for this person? are you unhappy being lonely. i assume you have family and friends around you who support/care about you. i guess i'm just confused as to why it seems like you're obsessing over something that shouldn't be that important? granted having a relationship is nice and all but if you're single that's not a death sentence

0	today, after waiting for 2 whole months i got the result from my college. i'm a 3d artist and i have been looking for a job in animation industry for a year but with no luck. i had been doing some other jobs for a living or freelancing. i thought maybe i'll have a better way of getting more contacts and  opportunities if join a college for my masters program. so i applied to a college and today i finally got my result from the college and it was a rejection. our result is based on a portfolio so they mentioned it wasn't competitive enough.       im very passionate about animation and art and i know this is where i'm headed and i already have the knowledge and already making my own movie. however, the result may have pushed me to push myself more, i somehow low-key feel like after all these years (i started 3d art a long time ago and also have a degree btw) i'm still useless and not worth it. it made me question my own art. i know i'm not that good but i know i'm not that bad either.       overall, i have faith in mother nature and there must be a good reason behind why this happened. i'm still not giving up and moving forward everyday.       tldr; same as the title.      edit:    so 2 days ago,  i got a mail from the same university and from being rejected i have now been accepted. i'm more than happy to have this opportunity.

0	here is a thought the main premise of cognitive dissonance is the unwillingness to change your thinking and attitudes towards something they have outright rejected, that why they people who display cognitive dissonance will just throw information at the subject left and right even if its a contradiction to the whole thought aspect as to what they have in mind. i see it all the time so i would just let it be don't sweat the small typos its a keyboard after all not everyone is proficient at typing and some people have handicaps in life that can impact their ability to function on a keyboard. the keyboard is not made for everyone to use that much should be obvious for any person to see especially if they are sincere with their thoughts about certain aspects of life, that is why i say rise above the mental discrimination, its a luxury to have people to spell correctly and is not a requirement unless your here to judge or getting paid.

0	that's all very true.  tbh, nobody should place trust in individual police they do not know.  it's not a relationship that requires trust, anyway, in fact skepticism and caution will serve you much better in that interaction.  the relationship between you and your lawyer requires trust, the relationship between you and the police requires a camera and a microphone at this point, but definitely not a shred of trust.

1	i will say in critique of it that while i largely agree with blanchard's typology, he pretty clearly only cares about mtf trans issues, and his theories just kind of ignore that ftm people exist.       also it doesn't really cope with the idea of someone being bisexual, which it seems like the majority of trans people actually are. the typology pretty much assumes that everyone is either 100% straight or 100% gay, and just realllly fucked up sexually when it comes to kinks.      personally, i'd say that with the inclusion of tumblrite aap gaydens and the acknowledgement of bisexuality being a reason for potential agp/aap behavior due to a wider spectrum of attractive features leading to a fetishization of one's own attractive features, it would be a nigh-on perfect system.

0	there's multiple layers to it but in the context of the culture war, people are still sour over ghostbusters and more so the last jedi and how disney seems to be handling their franchises. they see captain marvel (cm) as being shoehorned into the mcu, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the russo brothers have clashed with disney over cm's role in end game. the marvel comics are also recovering from some "forced diveristy" issues that has completely tanked their sales (e.g., female thor). in short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products.      more specifically, brie larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. in the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as snooty and posh. even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which she has been accused of before. gotta pay those bills though, i guess.      the trailers drop for cm and people are unimpressed. this causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive "incels are back to ruin cm" narrative. this attracts negative attention and people go to rotten tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. this intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. the shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger.      the movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider "woke". rotten tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. people fed up with the  "sjwing" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about trump's america being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, gamergater incels. the fact that the film has moments that would even make the recent gillette commercial blush isn't helping lol

0	i'm the last person to come on here and write a long winded post, but obviously i'm at my final straw. next year i'll be 30 years old and i have absolutely nothing to show for myself. when i was a teenager in college i was hopeful, enthusiastic, and genuinely looking forward to what life had to offer. fast forward to today, and i'm a broken, defeated. pessimistic, negative loser who can do nothing better than hop on reddit and bitch about my pathetic life. my parents both moved out of the country when i was 20 years old, which forced me to drop out of college mid semester, find a full time job, and find a cheap apartment to live in. i found a job in the special ed field working as a counselor/mentor and luckily found a relatively cheap basement apartment and a roommate to move in with me. fast forward 9 years and 3 different job. i'm still in the same field, although i am getting slightly higher pay (18.50/hr) and have basic health insurance. other than that minimal progression, i haven't done jack shit with myself. i still live in the same basement apartment that i've been at for 9 years, and the scary thing is i don't know what to do to improves my circumstances. i'm not the most motivated person in the world and am pretty introverted to the point where the unknown really scares me. at the end of the work day, i come home and am absolutely wiped. i barely get 2-3 hours of relaxation time before i pass out and get ready for the next day. i've been walking a metaphorical treadmill for years with no goal or purpose set before me. i'm not particularly good at anything except for being a creative mind. i love to draw and to write fiction. i've been working on a novel series with a partner for 2+ years now, but being that our work schedules are so different, we only work on weekends, which will take us forever to get to where we want. i love fantasy, it's the one thing that's kept me sane this whole time. i basically live in a fictional world in my mind. i use tv shows, anime, and books to escape my shitty reality, and i know i should be doing something else instead, but i don't know what. my old friends from high school are mostly all married, have careers, and generally have their lives figured out, but mentally i'm still in the same place i was 10 years ago, still enjoying video games and other irrelevant shit that won't help me move forward. thing is, it scares me how fast life has passed me by. i still talk, act, and feel like i'm 20, but the reality is i'll be turning 30 in a year and i don't even know how the fuck i got here. granted many of my high school friends had opportunities i didn't, but i can't keep using that excuse forever. people start at nothing and eventually move on up in life. why can't i do the same? i had a long phone conversation with my mom today, where she told me i should look into trade school in my area or think about maybe going back to school. thing is, i've been working the last 9 years. my mentality and lifestyle isn't the same it was back then. i'm home now post work and absolutely have no energy to do anything, just the mere thought of going to school right now and doing homework/research papers again... who the fuck has the time and energy for that shit? apparently many people do, but i'm just not one of them. as i mentioned earlier, i am an introvert by nature. i need my 2-3 hours a night to recharge mentally or else i'll be a complete mess the next day at work. it may sound like an excuse, but it's not. true introverts will know exactly what i'm talking about. so to wrap this whole thing up, i'm going on 30 and have absolutely no idea what to do with my life. i think about this every day and am worried for the future. 30 got here so fast, what'll happen once 40 hits? how will i ever be able to retire if i don't have a profession in hand? i don't want to lead this life anymore. i need help, i need a direction, and i need advice. any advice, no matter how harsh is appreciated. i'm real, no need for fluff. if you think, i'm a pathetic loser piece of shit who can't help himself, by all means say so. i can handle it. what do i do to make a better future for myself?

0	ingnore the speeling if your smart engounbg ue can figeew out anythieg, and that is the truth. if you can't do that then your truly fooling yourself and those around you because you failed to realize your whole mind is established on having information handed to you, you need to realize to rise above the mental discrimination if your going to be true to your intellectual thoughts and not block yourself mentally to what is possible because it don't make sense to you. in purist opinion cognitive dissonance stems from the fanatical scientific thinking that is willing to explain the complexity of natural effects as nothing more then frame work of ideas. think outside the box that is what they always say, but when you do your made out as a nut job more then anything. now i know lots of people want to interpret words however they want and to me you can spell correctly and have proper grammar 100% of the time it don't mean nothing for people will have their own thoughts and opinions even if you spell everything out you have in mind to the finest detail. this is no theory because some people will always find something wrong.

0	antinatalism is not a strong position imo, but you're making bad arguments against it      > if you are alive, you can enjoy a delicious slice of pizza. therefore by your logic, i have found one reason to exist, ergo the only possible conclusion is that you should have children.      by whose logic? i've never heard an antinatalist argue that there are literally no positives to being alive. their arguments usually fall into these categories:      - the challenges or bad parts of life do outweigh the good      - even if they don't, it's difficult to prove it convincingly enough to justify action (creating a life and rolling the dice) vs inaction (not creating a life, neutral result)      - even if you prove the utilitarian case convincingly enough, you've argued yourself into a moral imperative to have literally as many children as possible      if you're like the overwhelming majority of people, being alive is obviously better than not being alive, and it's absurd to question it. but it's not the case for everyone. imagine if your experience of life (the only experience you truly have access to) were overwhelmingly negative, and you genuinely would have preferred to have never been born. can you see how the decision to create another life would seem morally ambiguous from that perspective?

0	because when things are grouped together incorrectly without further context it creates cognitive dissonance. think back to sats or something similar - "which of these do not belong" type questions. our brains are trained to look for patterns and when we cannot find the similarities, or there are glaring discrepancies it creates cognitive discomfort.       you're saying it's obvious to you that some things are worse than others. i'm saying, based on the text, the author is not making that point explicitly or implicitly which is confusing. you're making an assumption. i'm going off of what is written. no where does the other make any distinction.
0	>i mean, if you want me to seriouspost, my main chemical/biological/emotional need other than food and water is physical contact with beautiful girls and the lack of that in my life has been really torturous and destructive for me,    >>to solve this problem, you need to lose about 30 pounds and trim that neckbeard and get a haircut. also maybe consider showering (like right now and regularly after that) and washing your clothes   >>>that won't "solve" it, that just changes it into other problems.      really nigga?

0	there are 7 billion people on this planet. billions upon billions of women and young women have given birth. it's what happens. bringing a child into this world under less than desirable circumstances is not the end of the world. i know a woman who gave birth at 15, became a dental hygienist and took care of her child. was it the perfect situation? of course not, but she is a good woman with a good life. if you end up not being pregnant then maybe get on some type of birth control . if you are pregnant just remember a child is for life and does bring a type of love you only get from being a mother. think long and hard about abortion and what that may bring to your life as well.

0	and no one should. i've noticed that comments on inceltears are usually loaded with sympathy and insistence that they're just "lonely, misguided guys". the type of sympathy you never see for misogynists in the middle east or india, that you never, ever would see for a misandrist or "radical feminist". many of these men fantasize about violently raping and murdering women, openly. reddit's response?       "let's not be concerned. they wouldn't have the guts to do it in real life."      nevermind the real life attacks driven by incel culture that have already taken place, carried out by men that incels openly admire.       the other day i had a pedophile apologist on there telling me that incels  who idealize underage girls are just opportunistic and not "real pedophiles", because "real pedophiles are afraid to hurt children and live in self-loathing." huh? if that were even remotely true, child sex trafficking would cease entirely. if it were remotely true, pedophiles would pose no threat to society. people really believe this virtuous pedophile shit. not saying there are none who are like that and are seeking help, but this idea that most of them are just friendly guys who don't have any desire to act on their compulsions?       deserves a second post. no sympathy for self-identified incels. no sympathy for pedophiles or mysoginists, western or otherwise. plenty of people are lonely, plenty of people are shy, plenty of people have social anxiety and are unattractive, yet most are not incels and don't subscribe to incel culture. why? because it attracts people who are shitty. the end.       if inceldom were a predominantly non-white movement, most people would acknowledge them as a legitimate terrorist threat and not just harmless losers who don't know any better.       phew..

0	well, do you have any programming or web development knowledge? i mean, this all can be done quite simply. run a cronjob (at x interval) to query the json/xml, throw it into a database, then have a script parse it, and an interface to view it.       i've thought about doing this for a while, but, alas... i have add.

0	hello, i'm moving to city x in a few months and am looking at places to live, can anyone tell me about the different neighborhoods?      "google could help you. stop bothering us when you could have easily googled the answer."      i see this sort of exchange a lot. like, heaven forbid someone wants *your* opinion on a thing. sure, they probably have googled it. and they probably still want more info. and moreso, they probably want to be able to ask follow up questions.      i'm starting to think i should leave this website.

0	this is stupid i know, but i been trying to find my soulmate (again stupid i know) for like most of my life and he's just not there. i don't even understand why this is such a big deal for me, finding love and such but it's so heartbreaking to me that like it's making me have a hard time breathing. by soulmate i don't mean perfect, i mean like mostly compatible and wants the same things i want and there's this connection. i don't get why i haven't found him yet, it's annoying because my standards aren't like high (i don't care about looks or money or that stuff), it's more so i want his personality to be specific to mine. can someone just kick me out of this stupidity? like of course soulmates don't exist why am i such an idiot about it

0	how do we know there are tribal peoples a couple of hundred years old? what's the source for that?      anecdotally, last year i met a shaman from siona tribe of the putumayo province in the colombian amazon .      he spent all his life walking bare-foot around in the jungle, drank ayahuasca for the first time when he was 7 or 8. the first time he saw the sea, was when he went to europe last year.      he died a few days ago at age 113 or 114 following a stroke during a plane-trip to mexico.      he looked maybe 90 when i met him. his 60 year old son looked about 40.      other than being a master shaman who has helped thousands upon thousands of people, he was one of the kindest persons i've met.      while his body had indeed become old and somewhat weak, the power inside him was unmistakable, especially during the ceremonies.       when he stayed with me, he told me, "you're one of my grandchildren too, now." i wish i had been able to visit the tribe in december as i had planned.      surupa, abuelo, may you benefit countless beings in the future.

0	you are missing the big picture. you think the left is parroting some particular meme back at you, albeit ironically. what is happening is that your entire meme culture/obsession is being mocked. the delight you take and the pride you feel over them is hilarious and pathetic. saying "da left can't meme!" isn't an insult, it makes us almost feel bad for you, because thinking that any of us care is kind of sad tbh.
0	you're right - i'm using "gore" as a catch all term for videos of people suffering and/or dying. for me, they're all in the same category. the only difference is the level of brutality. it's like the difference between soft core porn and hardcore porn. fills the same desire.       i'm not even saying i've never watched. i was all over rotten.com when i was young and the internet was new. it took a while for me to realize that those videos hurt you on a deep level that you cannot conceive of at the time. the effect is cumulative and it's permanent. i will never in my life forget the image of someone's head being sawed off with a knife, or a woman's toddler being hit by a train while her back was turned. too many terrible memories that shouldn't have to be mine, or anyone else's.

0	the only way you're going to get most people to contribute to the wellbeing of some toothless, obese, wife-beating, pill-popping fuck in appalachia is to take it from us by force. there's no way to "live as a collective" with someone hundreds of miles away who you've never met and would find objectively revolting if you did. collectivism is a meme that requires local proximity, cultural similarity, and a disproportionate amount of small-scale bullshit politics. if you don't currently have or want to have any of those, it's not remotely feasible. "muh corporashuns" are trying to sell you some sort of constructed ideal to embody, but that doesn't mean you can just assert group identity to 300m+ people and expect them to all love and support one another out of the goodness of their hearts.

0	we're currently living in a material universe in which power trumps all, "good" and "evil" are more or less human perspectives, i think we have been conditioned to believe in some sort of judgment from a higher power but the more i learn about the universe the more i realize that everything comes from balancing a dualistic force and the universe itself seems to be set on neutral, there is no preference for the dark or the light but only cause and effect within its laws of physics. take a lion for an example, if it doesn't eat it will die, so it finds an antelope and devours it for sustenance, from the lions perspective this is good but from the antelopes perspective the lion is evil, in the end the world is naturally designed to favour the more powerful force.      i'm not saying god, hell and judgment don't exist but looking at the natural order of things if there is a god, higher realms and heaven, then it's found beyond the material. here on earth the only thing that matters is power. if you ponder this sort of thing allot i would look into gnosticism, the gnostics believe that the material world was created by a demi god and that's why it's dualistic and imperfect.

1	in other tia posts i noted that gender identity activists don't merely want the right to be who they are or to be treated as just another human being, they want *preferential* treatment. which is how they can accuse statements rooted in biology to be "transphobic," because it gets in the way of being treated preferentially to the rest of the population.       that's also how you can still be considered a hateful, harmful, *dangerous* person even if you treat transgendered people the same way you'd respectfully treat anyone else. i have a strong suspicion the fellow claiming tia is a hate sub considers anyone who *doesn't* provide enthusiastic praise for being trans as "hateful," hence why i mentioned the anakin skywalker mentality.      which would necessarily include a lot of the transgendered/nonbinary tia regulars who aren't fond of this shit either. then again, activists like these are quite notorious for treating dissent among their own favored demographics as treason.

0	i agree with this sentiment about cao cao being the best warlord. liu bei just happened to have the best advisors and some of the best generals at his side, and prevented others from having the same.      one of the most infuriating instances between the two was when lu bu was captured by cao cao, and cao cao was having tea with liu bei. he asked liu bei if he would spare lu bu. lu bu, a skilled warrior, would have become a problem for liu bei in the future so he convinced cao cao to kill him... completely disregarding the fact that lu bu had saved him before. i really don't understand how someone like this is usually presented as the "hero" of the three kingdoms.

0	random number generators are better at generating random distributions of cards than most players do irl. very few people shuffle enough times, *and* with proper technique to achieve true deck randomization, especially if there's shuffle library effects in the deck due to how tedious it is. furthermore, a lot of players do some form of mana weaving to stack their decks. a common technique is to immediately pile shuffle into 8 or 10 piles after a game to "split up" the mana chunks so subsequent poor deck randomization is less punishing.

0	i've always tried hard in things. in school, i studied every day and got good grades, tried to do volunteering, did student council and stuff, and did my best to be a generally nice person. but somehow, my friend was always better. she got similar grades without trying. she applied to the same scholarships that i did and got them all while i never got a single reply. everyone seems to like her. i notice that whenever we are in a conversation with someone else, they look at her and only glance at me occasionally (i know, this is not something regular people would notice). she is even better than me in a completely luck based phone game we play. i lose in every area of life. i know comparing myself to her this way is unhealthy and self-destructive, and that i should focus on improving myself instead. but i can't stop. i've started to resent her for always having it easier than me. now, on top of everything else, i feel like she's a better person than me for not hating her best friend.       i doubt anyone will care about this, but i just really wanted to get this off my chest after so long.

0	that's fair. part of the problem is that the national media can't be bothered with the expense of *investigative* journalism: the time, the travel, the resources, etc. it's much cheaper to park a few loudmouths behind a desk and have them fire off their opinions, with or without the facts. it's true that there are some smart, capable journalists in the national media, but if they're not given what they need to actually investigate, it's all for naught.

0	yeah i think you're right. i asked parkranger about banning and she said something really vague about some people being banned for shady reasons during all the turmoil, and that she was willing to revisit those bans yet she wouldn't confirm who was doing the questionable banning. i don't know if it was her, trailangel, or some other mod. but she did reinstate some people who had been banned. who knows! i think at this point if the mods don't reign in the people who started the drama (who trailangel called the old guard) things will continue to spiral. but i think the old guard folks have too much power and influence with the mods so there is unlikely to be any action taken against the people who are stirring up the drama & so the drama will continue.

0	literally every talk i've seen greer give ends with him asking for money because he's so close to releasing something real but just needs a little more funding first.
0	i know this is two days old, but i'll give it a shot.      it comes from selective understanding. both of those points aren't necessarily contradictory depending on just how you're viewing them and how you're making those points.      the idea of piracy not being a lost sale comes from the idea that a number of people who pirate games would not buy it in the first place, and would only play it if they can pirate it. think teenagers without their own spending money, or people trying out a game because they *can* without paying, but wouldn't bother trying it if they had to pay for it. the idea of it potentially helping comes from these same people enjoying the game and recommending it to other people, who in turn actually pay for the game. along with some of the people who pirate it enjoying it to the point where they want to support the devs.      where this comes to potentially hurting the developers, well, the important phrase in the last paragraph is "a number of people". as we can see from these threads, the people who wouldn't buy it anyway aren't all of the people who pirate. they may not even be a large portion at all. for example, the people in this thread saying or implying they'll pirate it would otherwise buy the game if it was on steam. they're doing it to stick it to the man in their eyes, because they *are* lost sales. and they're using the fact they don't want to support the epic games store as a moral excuse.       essentially, they are valid points, assuming the "lost sale" defense is based in reality which i can't comment on. but a lot of these people just want any moral excuse to pirate games and will use whatever feels the most convenient. instead of just pirating and accepting it's wrong to do, but they don't care.
0	see, i actually enjoy and see the value of reading symbolism into things. but i can understand how the somewhat artificial and forced experience (asking students to write a several page essay on the subject tends to lead to some high levels of reaching in finding symbolism) you tend to get in english classes can leave some people a bit jaded by the whole thing. sometimes a banana is just a banana.

0	leftists don't think guns are evil, that's liberals. look at the tankies, they'd have a garage full of ak-47s and a literal soviet tank if they could. most actual socialists are neutral-to-pro-gun ownership and don't want to have to rely on the possibility of facing fascists and cops (i know, same thing) unarmed should it ever come to that.      leftists hate cops probably more than liberals because they're largely corrupt and made up of shitty and often reactionary individuals. they're seen as an organization that is overly militarized and who will use force readily to protect the rights of private property owners (landlords), while if you're just a regular person they'll turn up 50 minutes late and give you a hard time.       their self-investigations are often a sham and they incriminate and vilify people by releasing mugshots and info on people to local news stations even before they've been convicted of a crime, sometimes before they've even been formally charged with anything. also 40%+ engage in domestic violence.

0	yeah, the novella was written ~1500 years after the fact and not only includes outright fantastic elements (sorcerers, sima yi being able to twist his head 180°) but outright invents events (hulao gate? never happened) and it has a confucianism slant given the climate in china back then and the author having to follow imperial guidelines. its not really considered historic.      so you have to remember taking anything there with a grain of salt.      no, really i'm not being hyperbolic when i say the videogames saga is at times more grounded than the novella.      records of the three kingdoms is the book you want in you need an historic source.
0	as has been pointed out, the point of shaming abrams over death squads in the 80's was to protect venezuela in the current day, which is using ... guess what ... death squads to punish dissent.      i hope omar was just trying to score an unthinking point for the far left, and doesn't think that 80's era death squads were bad because they were followed by democracy, while venuzuela's death squads are ok because they are protecting socialism.

0	eh i am okay with this my family were die hard loyalists and got exiled to canada after the american revolution. though i find this a humorous take because the american founders were way more liberal than the very conservative british state. i mean this person forgets that the house of lords in the uk has representatives from the church of england.       being a loyalist usually meant your were more conservative most of the founding fathers were deists, had very radical beliefs on christianity or weren't religious all. this person is just assuming because europe today is more liberal than the us that was the case back then when it was the inverse.      also nice insinuation that racism, sexism, rape or pedophilia has anything to do with christianity and that its non existence would prevent those crimes.

0	i'm not sure if that sort of thing didn't apply to european kings, an unfit, unpopular ruler did not stay one for long during the medieval period. it may be that a critical analysis of divine right might be difficult for any learned man of the period to write down without having his tongue cut out and being boiled in oil. there are certainly many cases of western feudal lords withdrawing their loyalties and oaths at convenient or politically expedient times in a not too dissimilar manner to the collapse of the han.
0	how do we know there are tribal peoples a couple of hundred years old? what's the source for that?      anecdotally, last year i met a shaman from siona tribe of the putumayo province in the colombian amazon .      he spent all his life walking bare-foot around in the jungle, drank ayahuasca for the first time when he was 7 or 8. the first time he saw the sea, was when he went to europe last year.      he died a few days ago at age 113 or 114 following a stroke during a plane-trip to mexico.      he looked maybe 90 when i met him. his 60 year old son looked about 40.      other than being a master shaman who has helped thousands upon thousands of people, he was one of the kindest persons i've met.      while his body had indeed become old and somewhat weak, the power inside him was unmistakable, especially during the ceremonies.       when he stayed with me, he told me, "you're one of my grandchildren too, now." i wish i had been able to visit the tribe in december as i had planned.      surupa, abuelo, may you benefit countless beings in the future.

0	telling someone they are too selfish to commit suicide isn't "support".
0	i wouldn't worry about this too much.  i take most things people say on reddit with salt mines.  out of all the things i do, the things i've seen, and the people i've interacted with in real life, 99.95% of the time it had nothing to do with politics.  there was one time when a liberal friend of a friend started cracking jokes about trump when we were all playing drinking games.  everyone laughed, no one took it seriously, the night went on without anymore politics.      intentional or not, reddit makes things seem like they are as big in the real world as they are online.  every time i have my doubts and think "man do a lot of people think like this?", i look back at my day-to-day life and realize that it's not even close to representation.

0	i used to be depressed. for about 10 years, after dropping out of college. about 5 months ago after spreading myself incredibly thin trying to solve everyone else's problems in my clan, i meet someone who seems to just click with me.      no name but a letter. anime pic. everything should have told me this is a catfish.      but i was so fucking lonely.      it comes to be this person happens to be extremely rich on runescape, and offered to give me 20 bonds for gold premier.      the catch? i had to give them the 7 bonds i had already, because "it'll be a better gift if i give you all 20!"      of course i do so without thinking.      trade complete.      b has left the clan. b has logged off.      i'm just sitting there staring at those words on my screen.      this must be a prank, right? no one would do that, be nice to someone then backstab them as soon as they get something, right?      10 minutes pass. i haven't moved. one of my friends pm's me "why are you on that world?"      all i could manage to say was "i don't know."      i'd just gotten scammed because i was thinking with my dick.      i can't show my face to my clan anymore. they'll never let me live it down. i can't handle that. i'm supposed to be the clan mediator who helps everyone resolve issues. not the completely broken mask that it actually is.      so i left. never logged in again. on anything. totally off the grid save my job.      a month goes by. my phone blares notifications at me... "naive we miss you." "naive, hope you're okay." "naive what happened?" "naive we're really worried."      lies. all lies.      about a month and a half ago, i finally summon the energy to go to the doctor. i just tell her right out i'm depressed. she prescribes me 200mg bupropion, twice daily.      so now i'm on medication for depression. doesn't feel like anything.      until 3 weeks ago.      all of a sudden, i'm a completely different man. garulous, entertaining, genuinely fun to talk to. came back to my clan ecstatic. things are looking good for once.      except when you didn't agree with me.      then i was the absolute hugest asshole in existence. because how dare someone try to harsh my happiness?      so i treat them like i would any other asshole. i mocked them. i poked fun at all the words they say. and when they inevitably fight back, i get underhanded. start slinging shit that was told to me in confidence.      of course they respond in kind. and then i played the victim. dissected their words and arguments, completely contradicting myself at times just to win the argument.      oh i won the arguments. but now the entire clan hates me. they don't even acknowledge me when i speak in the clan.      i've become *that* guy. the one you have to tip toe around on eggshells because he might snap and bite your head off.      i've become the crazy one.      i'm not fixed. sure i'm no longer depressed.      but i've never felt more isolated than i do in this very moment.      they just wrote me off. i can't blame them. no one wants to deal with someone whose perception of reality is this fucked.      no one wants to hear out why i'm saying the things i say. no one is acknowledging that i said i need another break from discord. no one cares.      so i left. again.      i shouldn't be around people. i'm trash. filth. the worst kind of asshole, the one that *has* to be right.      don't end up like me. if you were depressed and now feel almost insanely good, see your doctor.      don't be the reason your friends give up on you. you'll regret it so much, like i am now.

0	from the link      for a detailed discussion of the statistical mistakes that almost all climate scientists have been making, see my critique of the statistical analyses in the ipcc's 2013 assessment report. the critique concluded that the statistical analyses are seriously incompetent, and further, that no one has yet drawn valid inferences, via statistics, from climatic time series.      my critique was submitted to the uk department of energy and climate change, by lord donoughue. lord donoughue also arranged for a meeting at the department: with the department's under secretary of state and the department's chief scientific adviser, among others. the meeting was held on 9 january 2014.      at the meeting, the chief scientific adviser claimed that there was observational evidence for significant global warming. i claimed that there was no such evidence—as per my critique. the chief scientific adviser maintained his claim, but was unable to present any such evidence at the meeting. he said, though, that he would later send details of such evidence to lord donoughue.      details of such evidence, however, were never sent. thus, the department seemed to effectively acknowledge that my claim was correct: observational evidence does not exist. furthermore, twelve days after the meeting, on 21 january 2014, the under secretary made a statement in parliament on behalf of the uk government. the statement was as follows.      her majesty's government does not rely upon any specific statistical model for the statistical analysis of global temperature time series.      global temperatures, along with many other aspects of the climate system, are analysed using physically-based mathematical models, rather than purely statistical models.  [hl4497]      in plain english, the uk government stopped using or relying on statistical analysis of observational evidence for global warming; instead, the government started relying solely on computer simulations of the climate system. in short, the government effectively accepted the main conclusions of my critique.

0	you know what? when that crazy trump supporter was sending pipe bombs to a bunch of leftist icons, i didn't see any conservatives responding to that by saying "well, don't forget all of the violent things that antifa does."      it's not because the two things are beyond comparison. it's because in tragic situations like that, conservatives are generally able to restrain themselves from resorting to "whataboutism" and trying to redirect the public focus to other things that fit a narrative. you just don't see that kind of restraint as often on the left.       even when antifa does things that are undoubtedly horrible and can't possibly be justified or defended, then if nothing else the left will try to shift the focus away and demand that people remember all the bad things that right-wing extremists have done instead.

0	if you're under the impression that vaccines are safe for everyone and don't cause injury and death, then you're either uninformed, in denial, or outright lying at this juncture.       since the first vaccines were created for smallpox, doctors knew and it was firmly established that brain inflammation, permanent brain damage and death have always been among most serious complications with vaccinations.      just in case you weren't aware of it the national childhood vaccine injury act was passed precisely because the number of lawsuits being filed against the vaccine manufactures for vaccine injuries and the losses they were incurring when they were consistently found to be guilty and held responsible for those injuries and personal damages in court was jeopardizing both their profits and even their continued existence.      you want to begin this conversation, that's where it should commence from. also take not that vaccines are not considered to be "drugs" nor are they held to the same rigorous and lengthy scientific testing that is applied to them, their efficacy, and any potential side-effects or long term effects that result from them.      by 1986 both congress and the u.s. supreme court had declared vaccines to be "unavoidably unsafe" and proceeded to deliberately shield the drug companies from any and all product liability for the vaccines they made and sold.       if you or your child was injured or died after a vaccination, you couldn't hold the drug company that made and profited from it or anyone who regulates, promotes, administers or mandates the vaccine accountable in a civil court of law in front of a jury of your peers.      now anyone with product safety liability can be sued when any flaws in that products design or construction results in harm to any unsuspecting person that used and relied on them but not the vaccine manufacturers. doctors can also be sued for malpractice **except** when they administer vaccinations that cause an injury or kill someone.      vaccines are the only product that the government both mandates and completely indemnifies with the over 3 billion already paid out in compensation for the serious injuries that have been proven to have been directly caused by them being charged back to the taxpayers.      now it should be patently obvious that the more vaccines that are administered to individual children the greater the likelihood that those kind of injuries are going to take place among them and  that is precisely what has happened and is increasingly happening.

0	this may be too strong of an emotional response for something like this, but it's a huge pet peeve of mine. keep your filthy hands out of my product; theres a scoop right there if you want to sample something! the store owner doesnt want anyone to sample anything, but i don't care: people will do it anyway and if they feel they can't they'll do it on the sly with their bare hands (more than they do now).      i mean, you people realize that others are going to buy this stuff too right? would you really want to buy some candy or mixed nuts that you knew people had been touching all day? no you wouldn't because thats fucking gross, unsanitary, and slightly nauseating. i used to care enough to stop people, but i quickly learned (on my first day) that if i dropped what i was doing to stop folks from sticking their hands in my product i would never get any work done. it's seriously an all day thing and often happens back to back.      shame on you woman who sneezed into her hand and then grabbed some almonds. don't think i didnt see you, guy who wiped his nose on the back of his hand and then later stuck it in multiple bins. don't even get me started on all the bad parents who don't keep an eye on their kids who then run around my department and end up plunging their hands (sometimes entire arms) into the candy.      while i'm here complaining: screw you people that have mixed up multiple nuts together in a large bag and then attempt to fool the cashier into thinking they are all the same price. we are not stupid and now i have to spend the next hour separating all the nuts one by one so i can put them back. or the people who fill up bags, change their minds (while eating from the bag), and then stuff the entire thing into a random bin because you know i'll put it back properly.      also, fuck your cherry pits, gum, pistachio shells and whatever else you have stuck into your mouths and spit on my floor without any consideration of the fact that a human being has to pick these things up i do not want to touch whatever had been in your dirty ass mouth gloves or not. fuck.      animals, the lot of them.
1	i haven't found any. i take some and leave some, practicing what i call "mental discernment" where ideally the untruth is perceived for what it is. it is a difficult ability to cultivate, but one well worth acquiring, since nobody seems to be telling the whole story.      there would be my own videos, but they are not in english and "only" pertain to life and mind. which are, if you really consider the question honestly, the only things we actually have.      in other words, my view is we should make our lives great, make them matter, and for that we need access to certain states, and worrying about what (((they))) might be doing is utterly counterproductive. it is still interesting to consider these things, but avoiding fascination or worry, instead focusing on bettering one's life.
0	no he didn't. he claimed the perpetrators were stingy with their value for equitable treatment.
0	what you said made me feel warmth in my heart and sadness on the same time. have you by any chance heard the term "highly sensitive person"? we (i am one as well) are a real thing, it's determined by your nervous system, which in hsps is more developed than average. almost 20% of people are hsp's and also there happen to be highly sensitive ones among animals. it serves a purpose, because they are more sensitive not only emotionally, but also sensually, so they are more likely to notice if something is wrong. highly sensitive animals are the guards because of that. it used be so with humans before we could depend on technology to be safe and sound. anyway, i consider high sensibility as some super power and with great power comes great responsibility.   i'm not implying that you are hsp, but doing some research on that topic might be really helpful, because hsps and ausies share a lot in characteristics. i hope i helped at least a little

"the way law enforcement authorities initially investigated this matter as a hate crime i believe was warranted, considering the past and the history."*      so what exactly does investigating it as a hate crime vs investigating it as a crime change in the investigative procedures exactly? that they only look at white people as suspects?      also,   >*had been elected months earlier on a platform of seeking racial unity*      so why jump to the "this must be a hate crime!!" narrative right off the bat if his platform was racial unity?

0	crowder usually has bad takes. that does not remotely mean that islam wasn't fighting wars of aggression in europe, because they were. tons of them. ask the greeks, spanish and nearly all of eastern europe. the badhistory post on that was equally nonsensical.      crowder is a political agitator, though. three arrows is supposedly a reasoned channel that views historical events fairly even if it's for a left leaning slant. that video was not that.
0	'and then there's physics' addressed this (years ago).      > so, what is his big challenge? well, it appears to be to identify (with 90% accuracy) which of his 1000 time series were simply random, and which have had a trend added to them. doing so would, according to doug      > > demonstrate, via statistical analysis, that the increase in global temperatures is probably not due to random natural variation.      > really? no, this is just silly. doing so would simply demonstrate that one can identify which of a set of randomly generated time series have had a trend added to them. it will tell you absolutely nothing as to whether the increase in global temperature is due to random natural variation or not. if you want to establish this you would need to base your analysis on what could cause changes to the global temperatures, and try to establish the most likely explanation for the observations. you cannot do it using statistical analysis alone. this should be obvious to anyone with a modicum of understanding of the basics of data analysis.      it is very obviously complete nonsense.

0	from the link      for a detailed discussion of the statistical mistakes that almost all climate scientists have been making, see my critique of the statistical analyses in the ipcc's 2013 assessment report. the critique concluded that the statistical analyses are seriously incompetent, and further, that no one has yet drawn valid inferences, via statistics, from climatic time series.      my critique was submitted to the uk department of energy and climate change, by lord donoughue. lord donoughue also arranged for a meeting at the department: with the department's under secretary of state and the department's chief scientific adviser, among others. the meeting was held on 9 january 2014.      at the meeting, the chief scientific adviser claimed that there was observational evidence for significant global warming. i claimed that there was no such evidence—as per my critique. the chief scientific adviser maintained his claim, but was unable to present any such evidence at the meeting. he said, though, that he would later send details of such evidence to lord donoughue.      details of such evidence, however, were never sent. thus, the department seemed to effectively acknowledge that my claim was correct: observational evidence does not exist. furthermore, twelve days after the meeting, on 21 january 2014, the under secretary made a statement in parliament on behalf of the uk government. the statement was as follows.      her majesty's government does not rely upon any specific statistical model for the statistical analysis of global temperature time series.      global temperatures, along with many other aspects of the climate system, are analysed using physically-based mathematical models, rather than purely statistical models.  [hl4497]      in plain english, the uk government stopped using or relying on statistical analysis of observational evidence for global warming; instead, the government started relying solely on computer simulations of the climate system. in short, the government effectively accepted the main conclusions of my critique.

0	i used to cry all the time as a child and told adults how i used to be treated at home . they chalked it up to me being a sensitive kid and one teacher even went as far as calling me a cry baby in second grade and refusing to speak to me until she absolutely had to.       home was hell, i was called useless , fat , dumb , and everything in between. i'm held back a year because they didn't bother putting me in school when i should have been and i'm just so pissed that i could be graduating this year but i'm not!       this past year i was kicked out of the house so i stayed with a friend. two weeks in my friend's mom suggested i try to make bite the bullet and go home because "you've always been a sensitive kid" . really ? go back to an abusive place , because you perceive me as sensitive ???       there's a reason i cried almost every day. i don't anymore , because i'm not around them. don't just brush off a child when they react negatively to something , real things might be happening to them but you wan to take the easy way out and label them as sensitive. i will never forget the teachers and parents who played dumb when it came to how my home like was. i will never forgive them either .

0	i wish i were kidding. i can't link names anymore because i don't want to get suspended for mentioning this user *again*, but i had a very high karma thread here removed by the anti-evil team that posted a pm conversation between me and [highest karma user] where he outed himself (jocularly or not) as a paid advertiser for companies, etc., and well...      i got suspended for seven days for "harassment".      today on the **sixth day** it was finally reversed via appeal. my appeal was simple. there is no harassment if someone messages **you** and never once indicates in the messages that they wish to stop receiving messages. that very clearly means they want to keep talking to you.      not once did [highest karma user] *ever* indicate he didn't want to receive further messages from me! in fact, the last pm i had sent him was to never contact me again, which he somewhat complied with, well, until he had his cronies (the reddit admins) falsely suspend me.      posting private messages (of which he was going to do anyway, evident by how he used it to rally brigades against me and many others) is a bit crass but **not** against the rules whatsoever.      tl;dr: do **not** talk to power users or anyone who may have an agenda against you. reddit admins don't actually look at harassment reports---they just take them at face value and assume the report is true. an appeal will likely be listened to at some point if you're not being a tool within it and **have clear and concise proof that they not only initiated conversation but never said "stop talking to me" or anything to that effect**, but it'll be near the end of the suspension anyway.

1	i agree that the joke is harmless, if completely played out and a little insensitive but man, just because it doesn't offend *you* and you've seen worse doesn't mean that nobody will be upset by it. pregnancy is an extremely emotional and sensitive topic for some women who have had miscarriages or are infertile and i think it's totally reasonable for them to be upset at something like this.      it's good to have a thick skin, but it's not good to discount the emotions of others, or to think you speak for them just because you happen to share a circumstance. besides, the "april fool's pregnancy" joke isn't funny, clever, or original. frankly, it isn't good enough of a joke to warrant its potential upsetting effect on other people.      edit: this just in, empathy is unpopular! wammen and their feefees, amirite?

0	the funny thing is that these people calling for civil war, genocide and such are the ones that want all weapons banned, the military budget reduced to nothing, and for no one to know how to fight.      do they honestly expect to walk down the street pressing the "x" hitting on their game controllers, and everyone they hate is just supposed to magically fall over dead? it's the very people they want to go to war with that have the weapons and training needed to actually win a fight.      usually in a war it's the young and healthy that do the fighting (and killing and dying) because their youth and strength give them an advantage. unless they are stupid and untrained. then the old and feeble (but trained) mow them down like grass.

0	today, after waiting for 2 whole months i got the result from my college. i'm a 3d artist and i have been looking for a job in animation industry for a year but with no luck. i had been doing some other jobs for a living or freelancing. i thought maybe i'll have a better way of getting more contacts and  opportunities if join a college for my masters program. so i applied to a college and today i finally got my result from the college and it was a rejection. our result is based on a portfolio so they mentioned it wasn't competitive enough.       im very passionate about animation and art and i know this is where i'm headed and i already have the knowledge and already making my own movie. however, the result may have pushed me to push myself more, i somehow low-key feel like after all these years (i started 3d art a long time ago and also have a degree btw) i'm still useless and not worth it. it made me question my own art. i know i'm not that good but i know i'm not that bad either.       overall, i have faith in mother nature and there must be a good reason behind why this happened. i'm still not giving up and moving forward everyday.       tldr; same as the title.      edit:    so 2 days ago,  i got a mail from the same university and from being rejected i have now been accepted. i'm more than happy to have this opportunity.

0	casual sex happens and when it happens to teenagers without fully developed brains they do stupid things like forget to pull out or wear a condom. people make mistakes and having sex is not like buying a car. it sometimes happens spontaneously and with primal urges. it's easy to say or should have worn a condom but talk like that solves nothing because it will happen millions of times today. hold people accountable with life long punitive damage to them and all involved(the baby). jc once said, "he who is without sin shall cast the first stone." have any of the pro lifers made a mistake or sinned?

0	we need to teach women not to rape. particularly, not to rape children.      the one trait most common in men jailed for sexual crimes against women is that more than 80% of them report being raped or molested by an adult woman as a child.      there is literally not a single more useful thing adult women can do to reduce the amount of sexual violence they suffer at the hands of adult men then stop raping them while they are children.

0	when i was eight, my sixteen year old babysitter molested me pretty much every time she was babysitting me. she'd threaten to hurt me or kill me if i told anyone. i was an only child with two parents who worked a lot, i felt helpless and terrified.       i told a select few people through out my life. people who i thought were my best and closest friends. all but one thought i was lucky to have pussy at eight. they expressed how jealous they were, only one was there for me and agreed with me that it's terrible. he's the only person from that group i'm friends with. they made jokes about how i must be gay if i didn't want it. i see this happening all the time. girls are molested/raped? "it's terrible, so terrible." guys? "dude, up top! fuck yeah!"      this shit needs to stop. nobody likes it, it fucks you up so bad. my life has been a terrible mess since it's happened, i'm struggling to get myself back together. i'm thankful for my best friend and girlfriend for sticking by me through this.       i just needed to get this off my chest.

0	it is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both. cao cao's character is greatly informed by his orders and actions, alternately being merciful or merciless, generous or greedy, piously adoring or rebelliously denouncing his superiors as is most expedient in the shrewdness of the moment. he simply has no underlying morality, though this is not unique among the novel's main characters. what may make cao so infamous is not only how successful this made him, but also that he made fewer oblations to filial piety part of his core public identity. his greatest rivals, the suns and wu, the yuans, shu, all make high profile acts of familial devotion and their close relationships (also often quite shrewd) pr talking points everywhere, cao cao does not bother except as necessary and expedient.       for example, shu plays a constant shell game of political heat between the oath brothers and they become masters at it. the most notable time cao does something similar is at the very end of his life, where he orchestrates a quick shuffle with his son where cao cao formally deposes the emperor and installs cao pi shortly before his death, then the new emperor posthumously pardons and recognizes his father as the actual first emperor of their dynasty.

0	i'm the last person to come on here and write a long winded post, but obviously i'm at my final straw. next year i'll be 30 years old and i have absolutely nothing to show for myself. when i was a teenager in college i was hopeful, enthusiastic, and genuinely looking forward to what life had to offer. fast forward to today, and i'm a broken, defeated. pessimistic, negative loser who can do nothing better than hop on reddit and bitch about my pathetic life. my parents both moved out of the country when i was 20 years old, which forced me to drop out of college mid semester, find a full time job, and find a cheap apartment to live in. i found a job in the special ed field working as a counselor/mentor and luckily found a relatively cheap basement apartment and a roommate to move in with me. fast forward 9 years and 3 different job. i'm still in the same field, although i am getting slightly higher pay (18.50/hr) and have basic health insurance. other than that minimal progression, i haven't done jack shit with myself. i still live in the same basement apartment that i've been at for 9 years, and the scary thing is i don't know what to do to improves my circumstances. i'm not the most motivated person in the world and am pretty introverted to the point where the unknown really scares me. at the end of the work day, i come home and am absolutely wiped. i barely get 2-3 hours of relaxation time before i pass out and get ready for the next day. i've been walking a metaphorical treadmill for years with no goal or purpose set before me. i'm not particularly good at anything except for being a creative mind. i love to draw and to write fiction. i've been working on a novel series with a partner for 2+ years now, but being that our work schedules are so different, we only work on weekends, which will take us forever to get to where we want. i love fantasy, it's the one thing that's kept me sane this whole time. i basically live in a fictional world in my mind. i use tv shows, anime, and books to escape my shitty reality, and i know i should be doing something else instead, but i don't know what. my old friends from high school are mostly all married, have careers, and generally have their lives figured out, but mentally i'm still in the same place i was 10 years ago, still enjoying video games and other irrelevant shit that won't help me move forward. thing is, it scares me how fast life has passed me by. i still talk, act, and feel like i'm 20, but the reality is i'll be turning 30 in a year and i don't even know how the fuck i got here. granted many of my high school friends had opportunities i didn't, but i can't keep using that excuse forever. people start at nothing and eventually move on up in life. why can't i do the same? i had a long phone conversation with my mom today, where she told me i should look into trade school in my area or think about maybe going back to school. thing is, i've been working the last 9 years. my mentality and lifestyle isn't the same it was back then. i'm home now post work and absolutely have no energy to do anything, just the mere thought of going to school right now and doing homework/research papers again... who the fuck has the time and energy for that shit? apparently many people do, but i'm just not one of them. as i mentioned earlier, i am an introvert by nature. i need my 2-3 hours a night to recharge mentally or else i'll be a complete mess the next day at work. it may sound like an excuse, but it's not. true introverts will know exactly what i'm talking about. so to wrap this whole thing up, i'm going on 30 and have absolutely no idea what to do with my life. i think about this every day and am worried for the future. 30 got here so fast, what'll happen once 40 hits? how will i ever be able to retire if i don't have a profession in hand? i don't want to lead this life anymore. i need help, i need a direction, and i need advice. any advice, no matter how harsh is appreciated. i'm real, no need for fluff. if you think, i'm a pathetic loser piece of shit who can't help himself, by all means say so. i can handle it. what do i do to make a better future for myself?

0	you're right - i'm using "gore" as a catch all term for videos of people suffering and/or dying. for me, they're all in the same category. the only difference is the level of brutality. it's like the difference between soft core porn and hardcore porn. fills the same desire.       i'm not even saying i've never watched. i was all over rotten.com when i was young and the internet was new. it took a while for me to realize that those videos hurt you on a deep level that you cannot conceive of at the time. the effect is cumulative and it's permanent. i will never in my life forget the image of someone's head being sawed off with a knife, or a woman's toddler being hit by a train while her back was turned. too many terrible memories that shouldn't have to be mine, or anyone else's.
0	well two things:   1) accounting is not maths. not anymore. computers do the book keeping side of things now, which is the raw number crunching. accountants work is interpreting those numbers and making sure they have been recorded correctly      2) simply using maths is not really enough to be considered part of the mathematics branch of stem. at least in my understanding, that is more for people who have math majors specifically, the types who are working out complex theories, using proofs and such, stuff that makes most of us go "wat?" and very little algebra and arithmetic. stuff that helps advance scientific theories, eg calculus was instrumental in helping physics advance, and i would in my opinion consider that to be the minimum to be a part of stem.

0	that's all very true.  tbh, nobody should place trust in individual police they do not know.  it's not a relationship that requires trust, anyway, in fact skepticism and caution will serve you much better in that interaction.  the relationship between you and your lawyer requires trust, the relationship between you and the police requires a camera and a microphone at this point, but definitely not a shred of trust.

0	there are a lot of nuclear facilities that are fruitful and operate well. unfortunately, i live in the uk where we have sellafield, possibly the most controversial and worst kept nuclear site in europe. a lot of people are scared and skeptical about nuclear power in the uk, and rightly so, trawsfynydd is another site that is in the process of decommissioning.              from what i've gathered, trawsfynydd won't be fully decommissioned until 2100ish, that's a very fucking long clean up process considering it was closed down in the 90's.              a professor actually carried out a study and managed to gather some data which indicated the cooling water which cooled trawsfynydd (which is next to a lake/reservoir, the only in-land power plant in the country) was causing abnormalities and cancers in the direction the wind blew from the plant. there are reporting of contaminated fish and many different leaks of material reported at trawsfynydd over the years, a lot of them covered up.              these were magnox reactors though, they're known for being quite 'dirty' in comparison to other production methods available now.              nuclear energy is interesting, however, after chernobyl a lot of people are scared of radiation and do not really understand it other than knowing it is a silent killer if things go wrong.              i'd rather have wind turbines etc, but we are facing a lot of backlash in the uk due to birds being killed by them, lmao.

0	i would consider myself part of the sex-positivity camp, and yeah, mocking someone for being a virgin is just as pointless as mocking someone for being a slut. sex positivity is about supporting people's choices, whether that's lots of sex or none. plus like, young people shouldn't feel pressured to be sexually active before they're ready, and i strongly think that's part of sex positivity. and lastly, mocking someone because they can't get laid/haven't gotten laid is really dehumanizing, it's saying that they're not worthwhile based on their sex life. as a sex-positive person, i think you should call that stuff out when you see it.

'pirate' games because you are a piece of shit who either does not want to buy it because you are a cheap ass then don't bitch when those companies go down under.      the same applies to anime, manga, television, movies, whatever.

1	i will say in critique of it that while i largely agree with blanchard's typology, he pretty clearly only cares about mtf trans issues, and his theories just kind of ignore that ftm people exist.       also it doesn't really cope with the idea of someone being bisexual, which it seems like the majority of trans people actually are. the typology pretty much assumes that everyone is either 100% straight or 100% gay, and just realllly fucked up sexually when it comes to kinks.      personally, i'd say that with the inclusion of tumblrite aap gaydens and the acknowledgement of bisexuality being a reason for potential agp/aap behavior due to a wider spectrum of attractive features leading to a fetishization of one's own attractive features, it would be a nigh-on perfect system.
0	the problem i had with get out was that it was a nice suspenseful thriller that just turned into a slasher flick at the end.  like had a good idea for the concept and then just ran out of steam towards the end of the writing process and it really ruined the whole thing for me.
0	back in my errant youth, "pizza" was weed.      weed is sold in ounces, and is often sold in 1/8 oz increments. a pizza comes in 8 slices.      looking to buy half an ounce of weed? you text your guy that you are looking for half a pizza. want an eighth? that's a slice.

0	there are a lot of nuclear facilities that are fruitful and operate well. unfortunately, i live in the uk where we have sellafield, possibly the most controversial and worst kept nuclear site in europe. a lot of people are scared and skeptical about nuclear power in the uk, and rightly so, trawsfynydd is another site that is in the process of decommissioning.              from what i've gathered, trawsfynydd won't be fully decommissioned until 2100ish, that's a very fucking long clean up process considering it was closed down in the 90's.              a professor actually carried out a study and managed to gather some data which indicated the cooling water which cooled trawsfynydd (which is next to a lake/reservoir, the only in-land power plant in the country) was causing abnormalities and cancers in the direction the wind blew from the plant. there are reporting of contaminated fish and many different leaks of material reported at trawsfynydd over the years, a lot of them covered up.              these were magnox reactors though, they're known for being quite 'dirty' in comparison to other production methods available now.              nuclear energy is interesting, however, after chernobyl a lot of people are scared of radiation and do not really understand it other than knowing it is a silent killer if things go wrong.              i'd rather have wind turbines etc, but we are facing a lot of backlash in the uk due to birds being killed by them, lmao.

0	and no one should. i've noticed that comments on inceltears are usually loaded with sympathy and insistence that they're just "lonely, misguided guys". the type of sympathy you never see for misogynists in the middle east or india, that you never, ever would see for a misandrist or "radical feminist". many of these men fantasize about violently raping and murdering women, openly. reddit's response?       "let's not be concerned. they wouldn't have the guts to do it in real life."      nevermind the real life attacks driven by incel culture that have already taken place, carried out by men that incels openly admire.       the other day i had a pedophile apologist on there telling me that incels  who idealize underage girls are just opportunistic and not "real pedophiles", because "real pedophiles are afraid to hurt children and live in self-loathing." huh? if that were even remotely true, child sex trafficking would cease entirely. if it were remotely true, pedophiles would pose no threat to society. people really believe this virtuous pedophile shit. not saying there are none who are like that and are seeking help, but this idea that most of them are just friendly guys who don't have any desire to act on their compulsions?       deserves a second post. no sympathy for self-identified incels. no sympathy for pedophiles or mysoginists, western or otherwise. plenty of people are lonely, plenty of people are shy, plenty of people have social anxiety and are unattractive, yet most are not incels and don't subscribe to incel culture. why? because it attracts people who are shitty. the end.       if inceldom were a predominantly non-white movement, most people would acknowledge them as a legitimate terrorist threat and not just harmless losers who don't know any better.       phew..

0	what you said made me feel warmth in my heart and sadness on the same time. have you by any chance heard the term "highly sensitive person"? we (i am one as well) are a real thing, it's determined by your nervous system, which in hsps is more developed than average. almost 20% of people are hsp's and also there happen to be highly sensitive ones among animals. it serves a purpose, because they are more sensitive not only emotionally, but also sensually, so they are more likely to notice if something is wrong. highly sensitive animals are the guards because of that. it used be so with humans before we could depend on technology to be safe and sound. anyway, i consider high sensibility as some super power and with great power comes great responsibility.   i'm not implying that you are hsp, but doing some research on that topic might be really helpful, because hsps and ausies share a lot in characteristics. i hope i helped at least a little

0	i wish i were kidding. i can't link names anymore because i don't want to get suspended for mentioning this user *again*, but i had a very high karma thread here removed by the anti-evil team that posted a pm conversation between me and [highest karma user] where he outed himself (jocularly or not) as a paid advertiser for companies, etc., and well...      i got suspended for seven days for "harassment".      today on the **sixth day** it was finally reversed via appeal. my appeal was simple. there is no harassment if someone messages **you** and never once indicates in the messages that they wish to stop receiving messages. that very clearly means they want to keep talking to you.      not once did [highest karma user] *ever* indicate he didn't want to receive further messages from me! in fact, the last pm i had sent him was to never contact me again, which he somewhat complied with, well, until he had his cronies (the reddit admins) falsely suspend me.      posting private messages (of which he was going to do anyway, evident by how he used it to rally brigades against me and many others) is a bit crass but **not** against the rules whatsoever.      tl;dr: do **not** talk to power users or anyone who may have an agenda against you. reddit admins don't actually look at harassment reports---they just take them at face value and assume the report is true. an appeal will likely be listened to at some point if you're not being a tool within it and **have clear and concise proof that they not only initiated conversation but never said "stop talking to me" or anything to that effect**, but it'll be near the end of the suspension anyway.

0	i think i really needed to vent this out and forgive me for it being so long.      in late january, my dad had a massive heart attack and almost died before his 50th birthday. he had 3 clogged arteries, 100%, 85% and another 70 ish %. my heart was so fucking crushed when i saw him the icu, all pale, ivs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. that week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.       all in the months of may and june; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in july.      i had to re-home my lizard because i am moving and she means literally so much to me. i fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me.      i got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and i honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me.      my therapist from since i was 2 years old, has cancer. it rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance.      during this entire year, i think i've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. i want to get help, but i also don't want to necessarily stop altogether.      so basically that was my year (so far). i have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. i mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (the most being my father's near death experience).      thank you for reading and i hope you can have a wonderful rest of 2019

1	the disconnect between what women say they want and what they actually do want reflects the principle of "alpha fux beta bux" at not just a microscopic scale, but also a macroscopic scale.      at a microscopic level: the individual woman takes sheryl sandberg's advice, fucks around with a long procession of different guys, then settles down with the stable provider she'd denied her attention in her youth. this may or may not include her bringing kids from a previous relationship (with some chad) into marriage with this provider. and this may or may not include smoldering resentment that she couldn't rope chad into marrying her, and thus cheating and/or divorce with alimony/child support from our dumb provider.      at a macroscopic level, though: "alpha fux beta bux" closely resembles the dysgenics explored in the movie *idiocracy.* it's a known statistical trend that fertility is inversely correlated with income and education: men and women are too busy "focusing on their careers" to fug, make babby, and leave behind the next generation. the shekels that get skimmed off their paychecks fund food stamps and section 8; the additional sales tax coin charged for their "furbabies'" sweaters fund welfare for single moms; the property tax money applied to their trendy but ever more cramped apartments or condos funds classes for the children of illegal immigrants and trailer trash. all this takes place via a combination of consumerist ideology (think about your next vacation to europe or your next car loan, not about how your neighborhood is getting worse), media domination (movies where men "man up" by subsidizing the mistakes of others; say something too out of line with this status quo, get mobbed by blue checkmarks and terminated from your job), and school indoctrination (do you think that unionized public school teachers, with skin in the game, will legitimately present the cons of property taxes or the ever-increasing numbers of daca or anchor baby students?)      just as individual women expect the future presence of dependable betas who never realize "it is better to be alone, than in bad company," the world increasingly demands the subservience of societal beta providers who never ask questions like "what am i really getting out of my taxes? when did i ever get a say in the changes happening around me? who is really benefiting from these changes?"

0	i used to be depressed. for about 10 years, after dropping out of college. about 5 months ago after spreading myself incredibly thin trying to solve everyone else's problems in my clan, i meet someone who seems to just click with me.      no name but a letter. anime pic. everything should have told me this is a catfish.      but i was so fucking lonely.      it comes to be this person happens to be extremely rich on runescape, and offered to give me 20 bonds for gold premier.      the catch? i had to give them the 7 bonds i had already, because "it'll be a better gift if i give you all 20!"      of course i do so without thinking.      trade complete.      b has left the clan. b has logged off.      i'm just sitting there staring at those words on my screen.      this must be a prank, right? no one would do that, be nice to someone then backstab them as soon as they get something, right?      10 minutes pass. i haven't moved. one of my friends pm's me "why are you on that world?"      all i could manage to say was "i don't know."      i'd just gotten scammed because i was thinking with my dick.      i can't show my face to my clan anymore. they'll never let me live it down. i can't handle that. i'm supposed to be the clan mediator who helps everyone resolve issues. not the completely broken mask that it actually is.      so i left. never logged in again. on anything. totally off the grid save my job.      a month goes by. my phone blares notifications at me... "naive we miss you." "naive, hope you're okay." "naive what happened?" "naive we're really worried."      lies. all lies.      about a month and a half ago, i finally summon the energy to go to the doctor. i just tell her right out i'm depressed. she prescribes me 200mg bupropion, twice daily.      so now i'm on medication for depression. doesn't feel like anything.      until 3 weeks ago.      all of a sudden, i'm a completely different man. garulous, entertaining, genuinely fun to talk to. came back to my clan ecstatic. things are looking good for once.      except when you didn't agree with me.      then i was the absolute hugest asshole in existence. because how dare someone try to harsh my happiness?      so i treat them like i would any other asshole. i mocked them. i poked fun at all the words they say. and when they inevitably fight back, i get underhanded. start slinging shit that was told to me in confidence.      of course they respond in kind. and then i played the victim. dissected their words and arguments, completely contradicting myself at times just to win the argument.      oh i won the arguments. but now the entire clan hates me. they don't even acknowledge me when i speak in the clan.      i've become *that* guy. the one you have to tip toe around on eggshells because he might snap and bite your head off.      i've become the crazy one.      i'm not fixed. sure i'm no longer depressed.      but i've never felt more isolated than i do in this very moment.      they just wrote me off. i can't blame them. no one wants to deal with someone whose perception of reality is this fucked.      no one wants to hear out why i'm saying the things i say. no one is acknowledging that i said i need another break from discord. no one cares.      so i left. again.      i shouldn't be around people. i'm trash. filth. the worst kind of asshole, the one that *has* to be right.      don't end up like me. if you were depressed and now feel almost insanely good, see your doctor.      don't be the reason your friends give up on you. you'll regret it so much, like i am now.

1	in other tia posts i noted that gender identity activists don't merely want the right to be who they are or to be treated as just another human being, they want *preferential* treatment. which is how they can accuse statements rooted in biology to be "transphobic," because it gets in the way of being treated preferentially to the rest of the population.       that's also how you can still be considered a hateful, harmful, *dangerous* person even if you treat transgendered people the same way you'd respectfully treat anyone else. i have a strong suspicion the fellow claiming tia is a hate sub considers anyone who *doesn't* provide enthusiastic praise for being trans as "hateful," hence why i mentioned the anakin skywalker mentality.      which would necessarily include a lot of the transgendered/nonbinary tia regulars who aren't fond of this shit either. then again, activists like these are quite notorious for treating dissent among their own favored demographics as treason.

0	i mean, it's sad that this is probably a tit for tat. it's a little coincidental that these 'restrictive' abortion laws came months after new york made abortions 9 months into a pregnancy legal and celebrated it. then it was followed up with a governor talking about 'post birth' abortion.      i think abortion was at as good a place it could be.  one side tipped the scale & alarmed a bunch of conservative states.

0	i'm not saying they're not valid responses, but i am saying it's weird that all the responses fall into      pee   mastubate    open jars      when a good percentage of the replies to the same question on twitter talked about safety, enjoying their hobbies without harassment, getting to walk places.       fuck, my own answer would be "i'd like to get shopping in my neighbourhood without wearing headphones and without someone trying to follow me home"      and all these replies are equivalent to "hey men, what do you like about being a man?" threads, but i've seen more different experiences on askmen threads.

0	there's multiple layers to it but in the context of the culture war, people are still sour over ghostbusters and more so the last jedi and how disney seems to be handling their franchises. they see captain marvel (cm) as being shoehorned into the mcu, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the russo brothers have clashed with disney over cm's role in end game. the marvel comics are also recovering from some "forced diveristy" issues that has completely tanked their sales (e.g., female thor). in short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products.      more specifically, brie larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. in the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as snooty and posh. even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which she has been accused of before. gotta pay those bills though, i guess.      the trailers drop for cm and people are unimpressed. this causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive "incels are back to ruin cm" narrative. this attracts negative attention and people go to rotten tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. this intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. the shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger.      the movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider "woke". rotten tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. people fed up with the  "sjwing" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about trump's america being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, gamergater incels. the fact that the film has moments that would even make the recent gillette commercial blush isn't helping lol

0	background: 21 years old, chubby, friendless, haven't kissed a girl or even held her hand yet. i feel like i've missed out on a lot of things i should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up.      every day is as boring as the previous one. if someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face.      it's sad, man. every year i feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. i wish i could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. the list goes on. but sadly, i can't change my past.      what's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. yes, i do have overprotective parents, but i should have done something. if only i had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where i was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time i opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different.      nowadays, i often act against my own interests solely out of fear. for example: some weeks ago, i messaged a girl i had been texting for around a month (i don't know if i like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if i actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since i didn't get an answer half an hour later i decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed.      right after waking up, i saw her reply. she answered 10 minutes after i knocked myself out. said she was at some club and told me to drop by if i wanted. a few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if i wanted to go. and that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour.      what did i do? i saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know i saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why i couldn't answer earlier. even though i really wanted to see her.      my lack of social skills angers me. i know i would've done the exact same thing if i hadn't gone to bed before her reply. why? because i fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). the beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, i'm not happy with my body at all.      it's not that i'm an introvert. socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. it kills me when i find something funny on the internet and i have no one to share it with. or when i want to go to the movies or something and i have no one to go with. i dislike being by myself most of the time. i'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. or even go on vacations with, like some do. but since i tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and i usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. and i'd love to go to nightclubs, but i don't have the social skills to really enjoy it.      i've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. lost 6% bodyfat but i 'gave up' again two weeks ago. i'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. that the door has already closed. the same dumb questions arise: "why would i want to be ripped at 22? will i even be able to catch up with social skills? will it even be worth it?".      any advice is welcome.

0	nonsense. do you forget the value the tower had while it existed? why is it meaningless because it has a time limit? what about the work completed there, or the shelter derived from it, or the lives lived benefitting from it? and when the knowledge or materials or skills that went into building that tower are passed on to build another tower, and another tower after that, doesn't that make the first tower meaningful as well?      returning to the topic of this thread, even if your life has a time limit, some use their lives to create more life. life is meaningful, but limited. creating more life from your life is just one of many ways to create meaning beyond your time limit... but doesn't negate that your life is meaningful even within it's time limit.

0	deciding what to do about climate change might be a political issue. but climate change itself is most definitely not, any more than gravity or math or electricity is. and the video is purely about climate change, not the politics around it. following your logic literally any video can be banned because everything has one political debate or another related to it.

0	any literacy test that tests above 8th grade level is going to exclude way too many people for either party to get on board. pretty much every news/editorial, reddit or facebook post or list of instructions is written on 8th grade level, i'm afraid a very large portion of the country tops out right in that range and i don't think it's a partisan split, they can make literal sense out of most things but can't gather anything more complex.

0	the only way you're going to get most people to contribute to the wellbeing of some toothless, obese, wife-beating, pill-popping fuck in appalachia is to take it from us by force. there's no way to "live as a collective" with someone hundreds of miles away who you've never met and would find objectively revolting if you did. collectivism is a meme that requires local proximity, cultural similarity, and a disproportionate amount of small-scale bullshit politics. if you don't currently have or want to have any of those, it's not remotely feasible. "muh corporashuns" are trying to sell you some sort of constructed ideal to embody, but that doesn't mean you can just assert group identity to 300m+ people and expect them to all love and support one another out of the goodness of their hearts.

0	i would consider myself part of the sex-positivity camp, and yeah, mocking someone for being a virgin is just as pointless as mocking someone for being a slut. sex positivity is about supporting people's choices, whether that's lots of sex or none. plus like, young people shouldn't feel pressured to be sexually active before they're ready, and i strongly think that's part of sex positivity. and lastly, mocking someone because they can't get laid/haven't gotten laid is really dehumanizing, it's saying that they're not worthwhile based on their sex life. as a sex-positive person, i think you should call that stuff out when you see it.

0	this may be too strong of an emotional response for something like this, but it's a huge pet peeve of mine. keep your filthy hands out of my product; theres a scoop right there if you want to sample something! the store owner doesnt want anyone to sample anything, but i don't care: people will do it anyway and if they feel they can't they'll do it on the sly with their bare hands (more than they do now).      i mean, you people realize that others are going to buy this stuff too right? would you really want to buy some candy or mixed nuts that you knew people had been touching all day? no you wouldn't because thats fucking gross, unsanitary, and slightly nauseating. i used to care enough to stop people, but i quickly learned (on my first day) that if i dropped what i was doing to stop folks from sticking their hands in my product i would never get any work done. it's seriously an all day thing and often happens back to back.      shame on you woman who sneezed into her hand and then grabbed some almonds. don't think i didnt see you, guy who wiped his nose on the back of his hand and then later stuck it in multiple bins. don't even get me started on all the bad parents who don't keep an eye on their kids who then run around my department and end up plunging their hands (sometimes entire arms) into the candy.      while i'm here complaining: screw you people that have mixed up multiple nuts together in a large bag and then attempt to fool the cashier into thinking they are all the same price. we are not stupid and now i have to spend the next hour separating all the nuts one by one so i can put them back. or the people who fill up bags, change their minds (while eating from the bag), and then stuff the entire thing into a random bin because you know i'll put it back properly.      also, fuck your cherry pits, gum, pistachio shells and whatever else you have stuck into your mouths and spit on my floor without any consideration of the fact that a human being has to pick these things up i do not want to touch whatever had been in your dirty ass mouth gloves or not. fuck.      animals, the lot of them.

0	i agree with this sentiment about cao cao being the best warlord. liu bei just happened to have the best advisors and some of the best generals at his side, and prevented others from having the same.      one of the most infuriating instances between the two was when lu bu was captured by cao cao, and cao cao was having tea with liu bei. he asked liu bei if he would spare lu bu. lu bu, a skilled warrior, would have become a problem for liu bei in the future so he convinced cao cao to kill him... completely disregarding the fact that lu bu had saved him before. i really don't understand how someone like this is usually presented as the "hero" of the three kingdoms.

0	random number generators are better at generating random distributions of cards than most players do irl. very few people shuffle enough times, *and* with proper technique to achieve true deck randomization, especially if there's shuffle library effects in the deck due to how tedious it is. furthermore, a lot of players do some form of mana weaving to stack their decks. a common technique is to immediately pile shuffle into 8 or 10 piles after a game to "split up" the mana chunks so subsequent poor deck randomization is less punishing.

0	this is completely misplaced.      people aren't celebrating steam's monopoly on the market. people are complaining that *publishers themselves* are forcing consumers' hands by setting up their own stores. apart from the fact that a lot of people just don't like the idea of giving certain publishers a bigger cut than they already receive, you need to consider that, paradoxically, this type of competition is actually anti-consumer.      it's anti-consumer because, when these titles compete on steam, they compete more directly. consumers have more alternatives: if i don't like one publisher's product, there's another publisher's product just a few clicks away. often the two are competing right next to each other. that means games need to compete with each other on quality and on price.      when every aaa publisher owns their own storefront which exclusively sells their titles, they don't face such direct competition, and can conduct themselves accordingly: indeed, this is often their express intent in setting up their own storefronts. fewer discounts, less scrutiny, more control over fan reactions, higher margins.      if you don't like steam's monopolization of the market, you need to outline the alternative program, not just cheer as publishers carve it up and leave consumers behind.

0	i think i really needed to vent this out and forgive me for it being so long.      in late january, my dad had a massive heart attack and almost died before his 50th birthday. he had 3 clogged arteries, 100%, 85% and another 70 ish %. my heart was so fucking crushed when i saw him the icu, all pale, ivs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. that week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.       all in the months of may and june; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in july.      i had to re-home my lizard because i am moving and she means literally so much to me. i fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me.      i got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and i honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me.      my therapist from since i was 2 years old, has cancer. it rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance.      during this entire year, i think i've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. i want to get help, but i also don't want to necessarily stop altogether.      so basically that was my year (so far). i have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. i mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (the most being my father's near death experience).      thank you for reading and i hope you can have a wonderful rest of 2019

0	op, you're clearly too *dump* to keep up with him.
0	i know this is two days old, but i'll give it a shot.      it comes from selective understanding. both of those points aren't necessarily contradictory depending on just how you're viewing them and how you're making those points.      the idea of piracy not being a lost sale comes from the idea that a number of people who pirate games would not buy it in the first place, and would only play it if they can pirate it. think teenagers without their own spending money, or people trying out a game because they *can* without paying, but wouldn't bother trying it if they had to pay for it. the idea of it potentially helping comes from these same people enjoying the game and recommending it to other people, who in turn actually pay for the game. along with some of the people who pirate it enjoying it to the point where they want to support the devs.      where this comes to potentially hurting the developers, well, the important phrase in the last paragraph is "a number of people". as we can see from these threads, the people who wouldn't buy it anyway aren't all of the people who pirate. they may not even be a large portion at all. for example, the people in this thread saying or implying they'll pirate it would otherwise buy the game if it was on steam. they're doing it to stick it to the man in their eyes, because they *are* lost sales. and they're using the fact they don't want to support the epic games store as a moral excuse.       essentially, they are valid points, assuming the "lost sale" defense is based in reality which i can't comment on. but a lot of these people just want any moral excuse to pirate games and will use whatever feels the most convenient. instead of just pirating and accepting it's wrong to do, but they don't care.

0	yeah of course, the main game of a video game, is to be fun. if it's difficulty impedes on this then it is deserving of critisicms.      but if the fun of the game is designed around its difficulty, and your ability to triumph despite the difficulty then if you're not having fun, it's probably just because you don't like that type of game.      so while bugsy3d can be critisiced for its difficulty, dark souls can't be.       i disagree that "git gud" is elitism (i mean it is a little elitist) , i think it more or less translates to "okay, so we could tell you the most efficient way to overcome this obstacle, but if we did you wouldn't have fun, because the fun is derived from learning how to overcome the obstacle"

1	he had to get a different date as a last desperate resort who doesn't care about the tickets at all. that chick would go on a date with him regardless of whether he asked her to go the concert or to go drink a cup of coffee with him. he fucked up by wasting money on some tickets for a chick who wasn't even into him because he thought it would impress her.
0	i've got horrible anxiety, depression and a stress disorder, i'm a cocktail of fun. i still don't find it insulting or offensive. in fact, i agree, it's fucking scary, because, old treatments for mental illness were fucking scary. the illness not so much, the people, not so much... but the doctors... yeah.

0	sjw regressive leftists see nothing wrong with that though, they view all white people as oppressors because they're the ones that are the ones mostly in power, rich and non-whites are all poor; the only way that is possible is if whites oppress and "steal" the labor^tm of brown and black bodies
0	yeah, you're right.       to be fair tho, sadness is the most popular emotion.
0	what's the @?
0	oh damn, that's tough.       even if it was a blatant political move like you're implying, tough shit. reddit has no obligation to give every political view a platform.       and since you care so much about "censorship", i'm sure you're equally mad about t_d banning users with leftist views.

0	ingnore the speeling if your smart engounbg ue can figeew out anythieg, and that is the truth. if you can't do that then your truly fooling yourself and those around you because you failed to realize your whole mind is established on having information handed to you, you need to realize to rise above the mental discrimination if your going to be true to your intellectual thoughts and not block yourself mentally to what is possible because it don't make sense to you. in purist opinion cognitive dissonance stems from the fanatical scientific thinking that is willing to explain the complexity of natural effects as nothing more then frame work of ideas. think outside the box that is what they always say, but when you do your made out as a nut job more then anything. now i know lots of people want to interpret words however they want and to me you can spell correctly and have proper grammar 100% of the time it don't mean nothing for people will have their own thoughts and opinions even if you spell everything out you have in mind to the finest detail. this is no theory because some people will always find something wrong.

1	another scandalous aspect of this -- north korea is not communist.       they quietly dropped all references to marx/lenin/etc. back in 1992 and right now it is just a somewhat quirky but not that abnormal in the grand scheme of human history regime of theocratic feudal despotism (the religion being the cult of personality surrounding the kims).       so why on earth would a r/communism moderator feel the need to ban anyone for criticizing it (setting aside  for a moment that people should only ever be banned for real and serious offenses)? that is somewhat equivalent to someone in the ussr being sent to a gulag camp in the 1930s for criticizing mussolini...      but then have you ever seen an sjw who knows anything about history and philosophy...       in fact the whole sjw phenomenon is to a large degree born out of the total collapse of education in those areas over the last few decades and is sustained by the militant ignorance of the younger generations.
0	casual sex happens and when it happens to teenagers without fully developed brains they do stupid things like forget to pull out or wear a condom. people make mistakes and having sex is not like buying a car. it sometimes happens spontaneously and with primal urges. it's easy to say or should have worn a condom but talk like that solves nothing because it will happen millions of times today. hold people accountable with life long punitive damage to them and all involved(the baby). jc once said, "he who is without sin shall cast the first stone." have any of the pro lifers made a mistake or sinned?

0	fair enough.  i didn't know the other sub had been made and, as stated, had been off the thread dealing with other things for several days (which i made the other mods aware of).  i made the post i made because i came back online to see just masses of reports by people who were reporting leg humping like they were trying to keep up with michelle's birthrate. my post was in response to that.  it's silly, to me, to get bent over someone saying, "if you don't want to read leg humping or, alternately, if the harsh shit pisses you off, be your own mod and mute the person who you just reported."  sadly, many took that to be supportive of whatever side they weren't on, rather than taking a moment to understand that, as a fully functioning adult, they could solve their own problem.  i do agree that certain people were gunning to start drama and that that's what happened...but, it apparently started days before my post, but i was a convenient doormat.

0	there are 7 billion people on this planet. billions upon billions of women and young women have given birth. it's what happens. bringing a child into this world under less than desirable circumstances is not the end of the world. i know a woman who gave birth at 15, became a dental hygienist and took care of her child. was it the perfect situation? of course not, but she is a good woman with a good life. if you end up not being pregnant then maybe get on some type of birth control . if you are pregnant just remember a child is for life and does bring a type of love you only get from being a mother. think long and hard about abortion and what that may bring to your life as well.

0	when i was eight, my sixteen year old babysitter molested me pretty much every time she was babysitting me. she'd threaten to hurt me or kill me if i told anyone. i was an only child with two parents who worked a lot, i felt helpless and terrified.       i told a select few people through out my life. people who i thought were my best and closest friends. all but one thought i was lucky to have pussy at eight. they expressed how jealous they were, only one was there for me and agreed with me that it's terrible. he's the only person from that group i'm friends with. they made jokes about how i must be gay if i didn't want it. i see this happening all the time. girls are molested/raped? "it's terrible, so terrible." guys? "dude, up top! fuck yeah!"      this shit needs to stop. nobody likes it, it fucks you up so bad. my life has been a terrible mess since it's happened, i'm struggling to get myself back together. i'm thankful for my best friend and girlfriend for sticking by me through this.       i just needed to get this off my chest.

0	yeah i noticed that too, i've been meaning to re-watch it to see if he dropped one at one point before that. i believe he may have.            the one very odd discrepancy i saw in the video... on the right side of the mosque upon walking in, when he walks over to that side, there are two individuals that are kind of in a cubby that would have been inaccessible from where he was firing. and even when he walks over, he doesn't bother to fire there. he leaves them be. are they playing dead? are they the survivors? idk. just found it odd.

0	the snark and casual derision really irk me.
0	nope. it began as a joke from a reporter. rick perry, sec of energy dept was all, "okay, if you say so" (or something similar, not rereading to get his exact non-response).       this has no legs. it's bullshit. even referring to natural gas as fossil fuel originated on this post as it was clearly mentioned as natural gas in the article. fossil fuel equates to petroleum for pretty much everyone and most of them have no clue natural gas is an export of the us.       the post title is intentionally conflated to try and add to the djt is an idiot pile, that's all; it worked as long as no one actually reads the article. it has nothing to do with wars, present or future, because again, it was said about a product being exported to england. it's been a while since the last battle between the us and england and it most definitely wasn't about oil.

0	> was i kind to him? well, no.      i'm just wondering what magical words you found to get this type of reaction.  i've gotten more bans than i could even count and have replied with all sorts of insane shit to the modmail.  i think i told one to hurry back to his circlejerk before he missed his cumshower...told another to suck the diarrhea out of my ass with a straw...just whatever craziness happened to pop into my head at the moment that was a bit more creative than telling them to shove their sub up their ass.  but never got suspended.      i guess it depends on what mod it is.

0	if you're under the impression that vaccines are safe for everyone and don't cause injury and death, then you're either uninformed, in denial, or outright lying at this juncture.       since the first vaccines were created for smallpox, doctors knew and it was firmly established that brain inflammation, permanent brain damage and death have always been among most serious complications with vaccinations.      just in case you weren't aware of it the national childhood vaccine injury act was passed precisely because the number of lawsuits being filed against the vaccine manufactures for vaccine injuries and the losses they were incurring when they were consistently found to be guilty and held responsible for those injuries and personal damages in court was jeopardizing both their profits and even their continued existence.      you want to begin this conversation, that's where it should commence from. also take not that vaccines are not considered to be "drugs" nor are they held to the same rigorous and lengthy scientific testing that is applied to them, their efficacy, and any potential side-effects or long term effects that result from them.      by 1986 both congress and the u.s. supreme court had declared vaccines to be "unavoidably unsafe" and proceeded to deliberately shield the drug companies from any and all product liability for the vaccines they made and sold.       if you or your child was injured or died after a vaccination, you couldn't hold the drug company that made and profited from it or anyone who regulates, promotes, administers or mandates the vaccine accountable in a civil court of law in front of a jury of your peers.      now anyone with product safety liability can be sued when any flaws in that products design or construction results in harm to any unsuspecting person that used and relied on them but not the vaccine manufacturers. doctors can also be sued for malpractice **except** when they administer vaccinations that cause an injury or kill someone.      vaccines are the only product that the government both mandates and completely indemnifies with the over 3 billion already paid out in compensation for the serious injuries that have been proven to have been directly caused by them being charged back to the taxpayers.      now it should be patently obvious that the more vaccines that are administered to individual children the greater the likelihood that those kind of injuries are going to take place among them and  that is precisely what has happened and is increasingly happening.

0	i've always tried hard in things. in school, i studied every day and got good grades, tried to do volunteering, did student council and stuff, and did my best to be a generally nice person. but somehow, my friend was always better. she got similar grades without trying. she applied to the same scholarships that i did and got them all while i never got a single reply. everyone seems to like her. i notice that whenever we are in a conversation with someone else, they look at her and only glance at me occasionally (i know, this is not something regular people would notice). she is even better than me in a completely luck based phone game we play. i lose in every area of life. i know comparing myself to her this way is unhealthy and self-destructive, and that i should focus on improving myself instead. but i can't stop. i've started to resent her for always having it easier than me. now, on top of everything else, i feel like she's a better person than me for not hating her best friend.       i doubt anyone will care about this, but i just really wanted to get this off my chest after so long.

1	i haven't found any. i take some and leave some, practicing what i call "mental discernment" where ideally the untruth is perceived for what it is. it is a difficult ability to cultivate, but one well worth acquiring, since nobody seems to be telling the whole story.      there would be my own videos, but they are not in english and "only" pertain to life and mind. which are, if you really consider the question honestly, the only things we actually have.      in other words, my view is we should make our lives great, make them matter, and for that we need access to certain states, and worrying about what (((they))) might be doing is utterly counterproductive. it is still interesting to consider these things, but avoiding fascination or worry, instead focusing on bettering one's life.

0	what's more important than a "thank you email" is just a followup email. you don't have to be pushy about it, but if after a week, you haven't heard from the employer, just send them a quick email reaffirming your interest in the position. you don't have to ask anything specific either, just reaffirming your interest is enough. oftentimes, the employer will appreciate your initiative if you do so.      ... never thought i'd have to bring in this up an argument about white and black people.

0	fair enough.  i didn't know the other sub had been made and, as stated, had been off the thread dealing with other things for several days (which i made the other mods aware of).  i made the post i made because i came back online to see just masses of reports by people who were reporting leg humping like they were trying to keep up with michelle's birthrate. my post was in response to that.  it's silly, to me, to get bent over someone saying, "if you don't want to read leg humping or, alternately, if the harsh shit pisses you off, be your own mod and mute the person who you just reported."  sadly, many took that to be supportive of whatever side they weren't on, rather than taking a moment to understand that, as a fully functioning adult, they could solve their own problem.  i do agree that certain people were gunning to start drama and that that's what happened...but, it apparently started days before my post, but i was a convenient doormat.

0	yeah i think you're right. i asked parkranger about banning and she said something really vague about some people being banned for shady reasons during all the turmoil, and that she was willing to revisit those bans yet she wouldn't confirm who was doing the questionable banning. i don't know if it was her, trailangel, or some other mod. but she did reinstate some people who had been banned. who knows! i think at this point if the mods don't reign in the people who started the drama (who trailangel called the old guard) things will continue to spiral. but i think the old guard folks have too much power and influence with the mods so there is unlikely to be any action taken against the people who are stirring up the drama & so the drama will continue.

0	this reminds me of this ***one*** cyclist i saw ***once***. it was at a 3-way intersection and there were no bike paths. this cyclist crossed the road at the pedestrian lights to an island a bike's length away from the footpath. for some reason i cannot fathom, this cyclist decided not to cross this very short distance and instead rode his bike for about 50 metres into oncoming traffic (the only side of the three with a green light) before riding diagonally to the footpath. the same footpath that was about a metre from the island he was at.             i've seen thousands of cyclists in my area, even teenagers, who ride safely. just last week i watched two teenagers on bikes cross the road when the pedestrian light was green and causing absolutely no threat to themselves or others.             if the police are going to punish any cyclist it should be the ones who are obviously riding dangerously and unfortunately, it's these ones who ***never see any repercussions for their obviously dangerous behaviour.*** worse still, it is people like the one cyclist who ignores the rules that ruin it for everyone else and just encourage the hatred that drivers and pedestrians have for cyclists.             edit: this is the incident i'm describing      footpath..............................................pedestrian light      ----------------------------------------------------------------|      <- direction of the road....................................|      ----------------------------------------------------------------(little island)      ->direction of the road  ^-<-<-<-<-<- <-cyclist |^      ----------------------------------------------------------------|^      ->direction of the road.....................................|^      ----------------------------------------------------------------|cyclist      footpath..............................................pedestrian light

0	well two things:   1) accounting is not maths. not anymore. computers do the book keeping side of things now, which is the raw number crunching. accountants work is interpreting those numbers and making sure they have been recorded correctly      2) simply using maths is not really enough to be considered part of the mathematics branch of stem. at least in my understanding, that is more for people who have math majors specifically, the types who are working out complex theories, using proofs and such, stuff that makes most of us go "wat?" and very little algebra and arithmetic. stuff that helps advance scientific theories, eg calculus was instrumental in helping physics advance, and i would in my opinion consider that to be the minimum to be a part of stem.

1	another scandalous aspect of this -- north korea is not communist.       they quietly dropped all references to marx/lenin/etc. back in 1992 and right now it is just a somewhat quirky but not that abnormal in the grand scheme of human history regime of theocratic feudal despotism (the religion being the cult of personality surrounding the kims).       so why on earth would a r/communism moderator feel the need to ban anyone for criticizing it (setting aside  for a moment that people should only ever be banned for real and serious offenses)? that is somewhat equivalent to someone in the ussr being sent to a gulag camp in the 1930s for criticizing mussolini...      but then have you ever seen an sjw who knows anything about history and philosophy...       in fact the whole sjw phenomenon is to a large degree born out of the total collapse of education in those areas over the last few decades and is sustained by the militant ignorance of the younger generations.

0	it seems you have a misunderstanding of everything i've written here. i never once stated or implied that i expect my partner to support me financially, or physically.  nor did i imply ever that i expect my partner to be my "nurse." fuck no. that's not a fucking relationship. i have enough nurses. why would i want that???      emotional support, sure, but i expect to support them in that department equally as much, it's called being in a relationship.       what i'm saying when i say "rock" is stability, consistency. someone who is there for me through all the shit. someone who is in for the long hall.      i have no idea where you got that other stuff from. but none of those ideas were promoted in my little rant.

0	it fundamentally places blame on others for their celibacy.       let me ask, why are you so determined to reclaim this label? why not just involve yourself in communities that give advice on dating and sex for inexperienced people, without the weird, unnecessary, violent baggage from that word ? it seems steeping stone-y to me, idk. you know, get frustrated, yet reasonable people on board. that frustration is bound to turn to anger, right . at least for a few?      this relatively new, fringe internet movement has already two shootings, with a community to cheer them on and muddy the waters for good measure. and god knows how many more on the way. enough is enough       you can have a tough time with sex and the opposite gender without putting such a label on yourself. god knows i do. but, it's super insensitive to all the lives 'incels' have taken. it's not a label worth reclaiming for whatever 'good' people there are that want to make a personal identity about not getting laid

0	not logically feasible. tournaments can be huge with hundreds of games going on simultaneously. you *could* limit it to the top tables where the feature matches are ongoing, but eh then what's the point. even in that case, there isn't enough money in the game to afford such personnel. also, a lot of players are very possessive about their cards, which have real monetary value. risking rough treatment in the hands of another gets some people really hot and heated.

0	if you want a good laugh, put "white feminism" in the search bar, which is how feminists only care about things that benefit white women(despite their insistence that they want universal equality), are insensitive to woc, and how they often start to shed crocodile tears about how upset they are or how you're victimizing for calling them out on it. it's funny how fast "not all men" turns into "not all white women" in white feminism threads, one standard for me, another for thee

0	i think they're expecting a big war in south america, and they want to be able to stop all the refugees (like china/nk).       either they plan to regime change venezuela or they know the chinese have been arming rebels against the puppet states down there and are getting ready to start a major offensive. maybe ww3 starts in south america this time..      if venezuela turns into a long war like syria, he sure china and russia will arm whoever is against american interests.
0	and so can lgbtq people. i see other people mention guys getting raped and how there needs to be more diversity, but just like this post, no one mentions lgbtq situations...      i'll probably get downvoted, but this is still the truth.
0	right, and the real issue is that flamethrower is way worse against celesteela or skarmory. even with maximum special attack investment, fire blast is probably the best option for the power. when you have no way to boost your special attack of 110, which is just ok by ou standards , immediate power is borderline mandatory.       oh god, i'm getting drawn into it too.
0	again with the guillotines.      it's amazing and kind of scary how people can fantasize nonstop about violence and murder and still think of themselves as the good guys.

0	i'm talking about police departments that have to deal with gang neighborhoods in general, but chicago definitely still has a swat team.  again, shitty police exist, nobody is arguing that, but when you have 10,000+ officers, you're going to have some shitty ones, i don't care where you are.
1	the disconnect between what women say they want and what they actually do want reflects the principle of "alpha fux beta bux" at not just a microscopic scale, but also a macroscopic scale.      at a microscopic level: the individual woman takes sheryl sandberg's advice, fucks around with a long procession of different guys, then settles down with the stable provider she'd denied her attention in her youth. this may or may not include her bringing kids from a previous relationship (with some chad) into marriage with this provider. and this may or may not include smoldering resentment that she couldn't rope chad into marrying her, and thus cheating and/or divorce with alimony/child support from our dumb provider.      at a macroscopic level, though: "alpha fux beta bux" closely resembles the dysgenics explored in the movie *idiocracy.* it's a known statistical trend that fertility is inversely correlated with income and education: men and women are too busy "focusing on their careers" to fug, make babby, and leave behind the next generation. the shekels that get skimmed off their paychecks fund food stamps and section 8; the additional sales tax coin charged for their "furbabies'" sweaters fund welfare for single moms; the property tax money applied to their trendy but ever more cramped apartments or condos funds classes for the children of illegal immigrants and trailer trash. all this takes place via a combination of consumerist ideology (think about your next vacation to europe or your next car loan, not about how your neighborhood is getting worse), media domination (movies where men "man up" by subsidizing the mistakes of others; say something too out of line with this status quo, get mobbed by blue checkmarks and terminated from your job), and school indoctrination (do you think that unionized public school teachers, with skin in the game, will legitimately present the cons of property taxes or the ever-increasing numbers of daca or anchor baby students?)      just as individual women expect the future presence of dependable betas who never realize "it is better to be alone, than in bad company," the world increasingly demands the subservience of societal beta providers who never ask questions like "what am i really getting out of my taxes? when did i ever get a say in the changes happening around me? who is really benefiting from these changes?"
0	the great part of this is you literally cannot understand physics without math, like at all. to understand requires a language in which to express that understanding, and for physics the only language which can do this is mathematics. i'm betting his "understanding" is a collection of incoherent pop sci articles about quantum mechanics.
0	the consequence of the classical liberal/modern conservatives' own ideology is the reason they are now being persecuted, and my people rejoice at these libertarian traitors getting what they deserve. praise elohim! next step hopefully is for antifa and american patriots to mutually annihilate one another.

0	periodic reminder that the moderators of [USER] engage in politically biased moderation practices and routinely permanently ban users even when they broke no rules whatsoever because they don't approve of their political or religious views      while [USER] should, in theory, be a nonpartisan and nonpolitical subreddit, it is in fact run by leftist moderators who ban anyone who they consider a "bigot" (aka anyone who is even slightly right of them on the political spectrum). for example, if you post a question in [USER] asking how to remove the gay propaganda icon they force down your throat during gay pride month, they will instantly ban you despite the fact that there is nothing bigoted or rule breaking about asking that question and it is in fact a legitimate question      evidently, the moderators of [USER] are very strongly against anyone who they consider to be "unaccepting of lgbt people" - even if you're not actually unaccepting of them, but openly hate socially conservative/religious people and consider us "bigots" for following the tenets of our faith and asking how to remove content we find offensive from our reddit page layout
