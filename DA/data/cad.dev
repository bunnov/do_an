0	this is because the cal poly administration said "no, we're not getting rid of chick-fil-a" on campus. it is one of the most profitable chick-fil-a's in the country as well. it's one of 52 chick-fil-a's to make over 2 million in a single year.      > lgbtqi students- i see you and i am so sorry. it is a really difficult time for underrepresented students on the whitest, straightest campus in the csu. i hope that in this broad conversation the lgbtqi students, faculty, and staff are heard out. since the morrill act (1862, 1890) public universities are meant to represent the people and demographics that they serve. it is difficult work for us to evolve, so i know that ridicule and condescension come from a place of discomfort. that's to be expected. my advice is to prepare for change.         here's another totally hyperbolic comment from another user      > there's a difference between companies/founders of companies speaking their opinions, and them actively donating to anti-human rights causes, and advocate torture and social exile for a specific group of people. so kindly fuck off      this is my ~~alumnus~~ alma mater unfortunately.      edit: wrong words      edit 2: clarified the second quote was not from the same user.

0	we had 2 years of a republican majority and a president who promised to repeal obamacare and replace it with "something great." he said that  everyone was going to be covered and taken care of. the number of uninsured in this country was on a decline and now it's rising again. is that *great* healthcare?         edit: that's not to say that either party is actually going to do anything to fix it. obama and dems had the chance and they gave us obamacare.
1	in you ss you say:      > the climate is changing, don't have kids.      they are advertising that idea primarily to white europeans.  they don't tell indians or africans to have less children.  they tell white people to have less kids and in almost the same breath promote interracial couples through media. couple that with  ngos helping migrants into europe en masse and you have the white genocide conspiracy.      i assumed you were talking about the obvious elephant in the room.        if not, what is the conspiracy?  maybe you should elaborate.
0	weird that you say that because folks have been marching and holding signs about police violence for years but nobody really started caring until one guy decided to kneel during a song.      kneeling during the anthem also doesn't inconvenience anyone, except maybe the nfl and it's advertisers, unlike an organized protest which often shuts down streets and hurt local businesses.      it seems to me the only people kneeling during the anthem hurts is snowflakes that meltdown every time they're confronted with a contradictory opinion.

1	all that you just mentioned birthed the alt reich movement. what the fuck is a breitbart anyways? i'd never heard of it before the alt reich, maybe it was around, but certainly not in the same way. sufficient that most people hadn't heard of it.      the cause and effect between the russians and the alt reich is really well documented, is that what you want help on?      these lonely white nerd dudes were always sexist, but it took a subversive directed force to motivate organise and radicalise them into the anti-woman activism we saw in gamer hate. those groups went on to form the basis of the alt reich, nay the very definitive core of it.      none of this has any leaps or unusual or out there ideas. these are all mainstays of the current and recent years media cycle.

0	u/search was a mod on this sub for a brief period starting around february, just as the smollett hoax began. he made a strange decision to enforce the "confirmed hoax" rule, which quickly became an excuse to remove any posts related to the developing hoax. some suspect he was effectively a pr agent who forced his way onto the mod team, and his actions have definitely split the userbase.      he has been sacked, however, so there's a high chance the sub will recover.

0	for the record, not all atheists are douchebags. seems like you found one. he may well have plenty to sort, but facts are what's left at the end of the day.      also, i understand that because of your upbringing having someone "take your virginity" can be a big deal, but know that just because you had sex with someone it doesn't make you less worthy. the emotional turmoil is strong, i'm well aware, but not being a virgin anymore doesn't make you a slut or whatever.      to me the emotional side of the story far, far outweighs the physiological slight change. a hymen maketh not the good woman.      rape victims aren't debauched people. you've been abused, deceived, to me you're in a situation closer to having been raped than just dumped. do not let this experience define you.      i suggest you read about the psychology of the raped person, you *weren't* raped but i think you may find info not completely irrelevant to what you're going through atm.       you take care girl, you'll be fine. keep on going in your philosophical path, to me it's fine if you remain a believer as long as that doesn't make you hurt others or yourself. but don't go around thinking you owe your family or a future bf / husband to remain a christian, a virgin etc. you do you.       peace prevails.

0	the problem is that the ev for theft in california is now positive.  a decent shoplifter can expect to be caught one time in one hundred or less.  if you can steal 100 items woth $50 and face only a small fine the one time you get caught then stealing becomes a very profitable business.      all theft should be criminal.  people who are caught committing multiple thefts have shown that they're unable to be productive members of society and should be punished much, much more severely.  i would suggest that the first time a person is caught stealing they should be given a fine ~ doublethevalue of what they stole, and a warningnot to repeat their actions.  the second time they get caught they have proven themselves unable to behave within society, and they should automatically receive a long sentence of hard labor.

0	she was the littlest of the 4, but she was the oldest too. she always just sat. never played. she ate, drank, and peed and pooped just fine, but never once did she show any interest in playing with the other kittens. i should have taken her to vet. i know i should have.       'course, it's way too late for that now. i found her cold little body, nestled between the other kittens in their bed. gosh, she was so so cold. i buried her in my backyard that morning. another dead cat to add to the list.             i'm sorry wendigo.

1	you summed up perfectly the reasons why i am staunchly pro-life.      your point about how someone who kills a pregnant woman gets heavier punishment than someone killing a non pregnant woman highlights the mental gymnastics involved on if an unborn child is a living being.      i find it reprehensible that women are so entitled to demand the right to have unprotected sex without having to think about any of the likely outcomes and that they just casually have an abortion down the line. any society that promotes killing living beings like this under the guise of women's rights is a sick society.      very few abortion cases involve rape or incest yet those are the rare scenarios that pro-abortion women always try to use to defend abortion.

0	this makes me sad. i have the complete opposite memory of sweet, kind babysitters. when i was little, my parents had friends who were right off the boat, literally, from italy. they had been in the country long enough to have beautiful daughters who babysat me. me being a fair-completed, blonde-haired kid, they thought i was adorable. when my parents were going to go out, mom would make sure i had a bath and some special "treat" like chef boy ar dee or something like that. my favorite sitter was eva, with her flawless olive complexion and lovely brown eyes. i knew she was pretty before i knew what pretty was! she let me sit on her lap under a blanket and watch tv until bedtime.    when i hear of so-called "babysitters" who abuse their authority and betray parents' trust, it bothers me to my core.
0	a lot of the horribleness going on right now, both internally in the individual and on the external micro and macro levels, fit the prohecies about the kali yuga very well: [URL]      i don't remember the textual basis for the specific explanations about the history of the gradual decline of the human form found in buddhism.      i obviously don't know from direct personal experience or empiricism that the following is correct, but now i feel like digging more.      the teachings i received on that topic states (iirc) that we've gone through what we might call a gradual grossification.      in the distant past humans didn't possess solid bodies, but were "light beings," living thousands of years.      at a later stage in the process of degradation, humans were giants, still with a life-span many times that which we're used to now.      it's kinda interesting in that context, that we've been finding skeletons of giants here and there.      we've slowly declined since then. we become more easily diseased, we increasingly ignore the suffering of our fellow beings, we have a very hard time questioning our persistent illusion (as einstein called it) of dualism and physicalism (which i think lay at the basis of our ethical decline), and it's getting worse.      according to the buddhist master i heard talk about it, the pollution of our environment is one mechanism by which the degradation will continue to worsen, until we reach the point where we're literal gnomes living no more than 10 years.      our ethical and spiritual virtues, our true nature of boundless wisdom and kindness, will be increasingly inaccessible to us, velied behind thickening layers of delusion and ignorance.      it is said that when the dharma (a complex word, but in this case it refers to the teachings that lead to liberation) is completely gone from the world and forgotten by men, we will have reached the end of the kali yuga, after which the fourth buddha, maitreya (who is, curiously, unlike most buddhas, always portrayed sitting on a chair) will appear.      interestingly, maitraya will teach only the basic vehicle of liberation, known as the theravada/hinayana ("way of the elders" or something like that, and "small vehicle" respectively), whereas the current buddha, shakyamuni, who appeared 2500 years ago, also taught the mahayana (great vehicle), the vajrayana (diamond or thunderbolt vehicle), mantrayana, mahamudra and dzogchen. [edit: the latter four classes of teachings mentioned were in most cases not given through what could be called conventional means and not necessarily during the life time of the buddha. adherents of the theravada/hinayana schools will tell you that only the pali canon truly came from buddha. conversely, the higher schools will always include the teachings of the theravada/hinayana, which are a prequisite, beginning  with the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path.)      the reason for that, is that the buddha knew about the kali yuga: how full of disturbing emotions we'd become, and how much suffering we would experience.      the mahayana is the path of the bodhisattva, and along with the hinayana it's prequisite for the practice of the higher vehicles, such as  vajrayana, which is the vehicle of transformation.      knowing we would have a lot of disturbing emotions and suffering, providing the teachings that allow for the transformation of that into fuel on the path to liberation, was important.      there's so much to say about this and so many interesting little nuggest to be found in the wisdom traditions of the east.      again, i don't know any of this to be true, and my basis for the above is almost completely an appeal to authority.      i'm going to delve more into the topic. i'll probably post the write-up on r/psychonaut rather than here though :)      edit: spelling + a few details.

0	naruto had always really been a story about basically-wizards, let's be honest. i was cool with the explosion of power as it went on mostly because the fights didnt become caricatures because of it-- it just added a lot of bombast.      bleach is an example of power creep gone to hell. the final (manga) arc of bleach especially devolves into everyone developing 11th hour power ups roughly three times per fight, and the final big bad himself was quite literally impossible to beat without an asspull. (as in, he was revealed to be able to not only see the future, but decide what the future would be, even when dead. completely omnipotent.)

0	i have scoliosis(a curve to either side in the straight line of my back), lordosis(the curve in the lower s of my back is too big), and kyphosis(the curve in the upper s of my back is too big). so, literally every way your spine can be messed up, it is. it causes me pain every single day. had i gotten a brace it would have been fine. then, my knees are very messed up. long story short, at 13 they had a quack do a surgery on my left knee and he botched it. it pops with every step and is just in general wrong. he's since lost his license to practice because of other cases. because my left knee is messed up, i've compensated with my right for 21 years. now my right is arthritic and i'm only 34. both of these things didn't have to be this way. we had top tier insurance. we had money. but, my mom was an alcoholic and my dad only provided financially. he was never home. my mom made either bad decisions about my health or *no* decisions about it.  by the time i could take care of my own health it was too late. so, i suffer in pain every day, and as i get older it only gets worse, and it didn't have to be this way.      edit: word

0	they *were* anti-communist, but you have to bear in mind thay "communism" to them referred to a very narrow political movement at the time, and it was an **entirely** leninist one.  other communists rarely adopt the capital-c communist label since mls (or mlms) always get to it first.      in any case though, he's explained that he doesn't go after communists for the same reason he doesn't go after monarchists.  they're completely irrelevant.

0	the most important argument i emphasize is that sanders is a political candidate just like everyone else.      it's crazy how so many americans (particularly young voters) thought and still think he's some sort of pure newcomer that doesn't have the problems that other presidential candidates do. they say he's not corrupt, represents the working class, truly connects to people, and would bring sweeping changes such as large taxes on the one percent and free college.       in reality, sanders is irresponsible, lacks the pragmatic ability to put ideas into practice, and has remained grossly over-simplistic on the economy, race, international affairs, and other issues. his personal history speaks volumes to his ineptitude as a candidate. in particular, his lack of significant work to show his commitment to politics and the country.       his actions are self-centered (e.g., continuing to campaign when he had no chance of winning and continuing internal strife within the democratic party, etc.), immature (e.g., as though every thing that happened in the country was primarily some sort of rigged, systematic injustice carried out by elitist individuals who control everything. and, seriously, "feel the bern?" is your campaign slogan? not to mention all the ridiculous memes portraying him this way. because everyone knows memes are well-justified, valid arguments about knowledge.), and in many ways more dangerous than trump's actions, in my opinion. and he's a socialist. i'm not voting for a socialist.      the primary reason why he didn't face much opposition was because the republican party and republican citizens generally wanted to stir conflict between sanders and clinton (so they didn't want to give clinton ammo), and that they would save much of their attack for the general election against clinton herself.

0	i think the idea of duality explains the nature of freemasonry very well. we've all heard stories about freemasons being involved in a lot of conspiracies and the like so i studied a little and i've met quite a few low level masons myself. even thought they deny it, they have a tendency for the occult and of keeping secrets, but overall freemasonry teaches them a lot of good things. a popular myth is that lucifer is the god of freemasonry, which is true, their version of lucifer is that of a benevolent being who represents knowledge and truth and they believe a true mason must constantly seek knowledge for the sake of others. the same thing can't be said about the high ranking masons, who worship a lot of wicked deities.      a good example of those high ranking masons could be the british royal family, like prince william and queen elizabeth, because a lot of members of that family are 32-33 degree masons, the rothschilds themselves have married with the british royals and they have married with a lot of the european noble families over time, like the aldobrandini family, which is part of the italian/black nobility families. so their wealth has grown over time. the rothschilds were involved in grooming clinton for presidency months before she launched her candidacy. and they also bailed out trump when he almost broke his father's business so they've been involved with a lot of politicians and it's safe to say a lot of those nobles i mentioned before are involved in the whole mess too.      so you see, both the stories about freemasonry being a friendly fraternity with slight occult leanings and the ones of the masons being dark occultist being involved in conspiracies are true simultaneously. that's why i consider freemasonry to be a secret society despite the fact that a lot of masons like to sell themselves as being part of an "open society". keeping secrets is common for even the low level members and the high level members are involved in a lot of corrupt things.      what interesting facts do you know about freemasonry and other secret societies?

1	israel has an impressive nuclear arsenal, and submarines to deliver it. of course, they built none of it themselves. also keep in mind they are an extremely vengeful bunch, and many still believe europeans/christians tried to "exterminate" them.      about the samson option:      > we possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at rome. most european capitals are targets for our air force. let me quote general moshe dayan: 'israel must be like a mad dog, too dangerous to bother.' i consider it all hopeless at this point. we shall have to try to prevent things from coming to that, if at all possible. our armed forces, however, are not the thirtieth strongest in the world, but rather the second or third. we have the capability to take the world down with us. and i can assure you that that will happen before israel goes under.

0	they are the huge conspiracy theorists now.              just ask any of them about the covington high school fiasco. they still think that all the liars and media outlets are innocent (or "just as much assholes as everybody else"), and that the kid did something wrong. they think the whole fiasco reflected so poorly on the msm because of a big set up.               they are still unable to say anything among the lines of "we were wrong about jussie" and make up elaborate bs anytime he's brought up.                  mullers report said there is "no evidence of collusion", but obstruction wasn't ruled out. they still can't wrap their minds around that, claiming that collusion is still up in air.
1	why are you so obsessed with sps? it's not that hard, just don't go to subs you don't like lol. you, ahs, and top-tards just can't seem to figure that out. like just don't go to them, it's that easy. yet no matter how many times people like you get it hammered into their skull, you just can't figure it out. its like the answer to your problems is so close, yet *so far away* lol.

0	served no other purpose.  your opinion of what purpose they serve is fine.  have it.  don't impose it on other people.  new zealand is not the u.s. or other places that claim to be the free world.  here, the expectation is that people are not delicate flowers.  we are exposed to horrible shit every day.  we can make our own decisions about what we see and how we see it.  yet assholes with opinions like you sit there in your armchairs and suddenly become dictators when you force the decision on others.  there is a threshold of what is censorship, and you crossed it.  now you try to justify it by spewing blow hard bullshit about child porn.  fuck off.

0	the removal and censorship was pretty counter intuitive. people that actually enjoy watching people die will go to places like bestgore and other weirdo gore websites full of people that get a kick out of watching people get ripped apart. the subreddit was nice because you could see how this stuff happened easily because it would appear in your home feed sometimes and if you didn't wan't to see it you could just scroll. hiding the fact that car crashes are a thing and people will die in accidents is stupid. r/watchpeopledie was well moderated and didn't have the toxicity of other websites. now if i want to see that stuff i have to go out of my way and look it up on different websites which isn't easily done on mobile.

0	i definitely think that animal therapy programs are a good way to bridge that gap.  back in my uni years, i did a term project on animal-assisted therapy (i considered it as a career) and was just amazed at the metrics when it came to turning around juvenile offenders by placing them in care positions (such as with horses or rehabbing abused dogs).  the work done with the elderly and infirm, especially with cats and their purrs having bone growth properties are just amazing.      but again, a hospital, a nursing home is a place you can't even wear perfume.  you could, possibly, *kill* someone by bringing an animal inside an environment like that.  it's the kind of thing that has to be case-by-case and can't negatively impact innocent bystanders.

0	my best guess is that either he has a hard time finding a girlfriend and/or is always single, so hanging out with his friends is like the only socializing he gets. it's understandable, but obviously he should be happy for his friend that he has a girlfriend, not upset at him for supposedly "neglecting" him. that's why "bros before hoes" is such bullshit. i'd never get mad at a female friend for not hanging out with me as much because they're busy having a boyfriend, husband, or family. i'd be happy for them and understand.      for whatever reason it seems like men have a harder time coming to terms with their feelings towards their male friends because "no homo" so they just freak out and lash out at them instead of just like, communicating to them about it calmly.

0	burning all books to stop people from reading at all is 'clearly and indisputably' not the same thing as specifically censoring certain material.  it even says 'parts' right there in the definition you quoted to help.  the two things are in the same ballpark but not the same at all in intent or result.      bradbury making the story about burning all books was obviously going for something broader than censorship.  and whaddya know this aligns with what he actually said he was trying to talk about.

0	imagine being this brainwashed and gullible to leftwing propaganda.
0	i would say honest abe lincoln would have more problems with an open-ended investigation that was based on a false report (the steele dossier).  a defense of the republic requires us to be vigilant of any overreach of government power, and the power of a prosecutor with a blank check to investigate anything is among the most dangerous power there is.      then there's the fact that as you pointed out so many leaks during the mueller investigation.  does anyone seriously believe that if the investigation uncovered a "smoking gun" evidence that it won't be leaked and end up on the front page of the nyt the very next day?  the fact no such event happened strongly suggests that mueller tried for nearly 2 years but couldn't find any crime to tie to trump.

0	>one that doesn't apply to other relationships in problematic ways      well there's the power dynamic argument. there are incestuous relationships without obvious power imbalances, but i would argue that all of them have some degree of it, though some is stemming from the fact that it's a societal taboo.      >risk of birth defects      i think this is a bit of a simplification. inbreeding is more harmful as a practice than the individual instances. while contraception makes this less of a moral argument against individual instances, comparing it to people with dwarfism having sex is a bit misleading. though on a related note: this movie is hilariously bad.

0	don't know if your still searching the job market but:      i was kind of in a similar situation to yours. got rejected from a 3d art school, and they pretty much took anyone so i felt like shit. at that point i had also been looking for employment for more than a year and i just kept getting rejected/no answer.      i eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (artella.com). this was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. at this point i was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc.       getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, i really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most vfx houses). someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/vfx.      you tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. i was fully aware of that when i was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. but i wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. sure there are people that grow out it, but i've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years.      keep improving, keep applying, and approach recruiters on linkedin informally, have chats with them about future opportunities. they're a lot more friendly than most people realize ;)       best of luck.

0	there will never be a vicky iii
0	no, at the time.  he didn't come across with another date until he found someone he thought was interested in him.  she did wrong but he also did when he made arrangements with her knowing she was the backup in case he didn't find someone better.  they both wanted what they wanted and were unwilling to possibly do without in order to treat another person kindly.      he could have said that their arrangements to go together were contingent on whether he found a person that was dating material to go with him.  that's fine.   you have to think that some women are told guys are just going to use them for sex, so finding out a guy doesn't want to do something friendly together when he doesn't think he will score bugs some women.  like being friend zoned does for men.        they both did wrong, but i think she was the one with the most responsibility because she shouldn't have accepted the offer if she didn't want to date him.

0	r/political"humor" was proven to have a large number of russian troll accounts.
0	i've heard people (even on this sub) say they got bullied for it, which is not necessarily specific to asexuals (people can be bullied for just about anything), but i thought it worth mentioning.      beyond that, the two biggest problems asexuals seem to face are 1) not knowing it's possible to be asexual and thinking there is something wrong with them if they don't want sex, and 2) loneliness in adulthood. this applies to aromantics as well. both groups blame society for the second one because of how romantic relationships are normalized to the exclusion of other relationship types (i'm told keeping friends can be difficult when everyone else in your group is married), and romantic relationships after one's teenage years are expected to involve sex.      true, the oppression aces face doesn't remotely compare to a gay or bi person being killed for their sexuality, but it also isn't nothing.      this is not to be confused with the ***totally valid oppressions*** (read that with a heavy dose of sarcasm) of being kicked out of the lgbt community... *for not being oppressed enough*, and not seeing enough people like themselves in fiction and the media. those are mere symptoms of the deeper problem, and yet they are the things tumblr and twitter aces seem to get the most pissy about.

0	men are much more shamed in media for doing 'girly' things than when girls do 'manly' things. (wife-fu tv trope ring a bell?)   our male-guided society simply considers masculine preferable to feminine. again, this is very general, and i'm not like implying that trans men have a walk in the park or anything, but they do get a fraction of ridicule and negative attention that trans women get, and i think there's a reason for that. but that's another can of worms

0	its not because of corrupt governments (okay some of it is) but the vast vast vast majority of the problem is that the people trying to help do not understand economics.      we ship food, we ship mosquito nets and medicine to these poor places. but how do the locals compete with a product that is free? if i want to manufacture mosquito nets and sell them, who will buy my product when they are being given out for free? if i'm a farmer, how do i sell my crop, when the market is being flooded with free food? we are putting locals out of business. we are creating welfare dependents and then, most insidiously, we change the amount being given year by year. we destroy industries and then cut aid a few years later leaving people to starve and die of malaria.      if we wanted to actually help, we would build industries in those places and create jobs so that they can support themselves instead of being reliant on aid. if anyone who reads this wants to help poorer countries, [URL] groups together microloans for 3rd world countries. it helps far more than throwing free goods and services at them, and the majority of loans are repaid so your donation (loan) is very likely to get returned to you so you can loan it again.
0	>younger people seem to have this need for attention and engagement that isn't even political      i think it's the whole incel thing that they are secluded and lonely and trying to find something to bond over. and the conservative grifters seem really good at taking taking incel loneliness and weaponizing it. i personally don't get how all of them didn't learn introspection because no matter how sad and lonely i am i know most of my problems are my own and most people just want to live a secure and happy life.
0	abortion drama is my favorite drama tbh. mainly because rightoids seem to know absolutely nothing about abortion and always make up the most outlandish shit.      the post-birth abortion thing is interesting because it reveals they never actually read the law, attempted to comprehend it, or even know how "late-term abortion" is performed or why.

0	well i identified that way from about age 14-16. i never would have if i hadn't been on tumblr. i'm designated female at birth, and i never liked being a girl, mainly because of the way our society and past societies have treated women. also, i was always a bit of a "tom boy." so i thought the label "genderfluid" fit what i was going through. some days, i would feel masculine, and some days i would feel feminine and want to be perceived as such. i now realize those feelings were probably a result of me going through puberty.       side note: i also identified as asexual when i was 14. i think this is really messed up, as most 14-year-olds are too young to think about sex, yet being on tumblr and seeing that culture told me it was ok to identify that way and i wasn't too young to know i was asexual. it turns out i was just a lesbian with repressed feelings.      originally i decided to stop identifying as genderfluid because i started dating and i didn't feel like i could adequately explain it on a dating website (yes really), so i thought "if i'm not serious enough about this to explain it to someone i might date in the future, what's the point," so now i just identify as female.       this is now why i am so against tumblr identity politics. it's really messed up to see these kids go through what i had to go through because they were impressionable and misinformed. i've seen plenty of people who used to identify as "demiromantic lithrosexual bigender" when it turned out they were just gay or trans or even bisexual but they were young and wanted labels and didn't quite understand what they were going through. tumblr encourages this and shames people who disagree even though it's toxic and can set people who actually want to find an identity back a good 2 years.       tldr labels bad tumblr bad puberty and repressed lesbian feelings

0	here's another article where she does an interview and talks about how she went to the doctor and he gave her sleeping pills, if you're into that sort of thing.  it does also have a response from the company, which is interesting:      >the incident at the sterling heights assembly plant in february was the  subject of an exhaustive investigation conducted by external  investigators. although we have been unable to identify the person  responsible, if and when that person is identified, their relationship  with the company will be terminated. fca will continue to conduct  focused training to underscore the value of diversity and inclusion.  this type of behavior will simply not be tolerated.      they're either accepting that it was intended to be a noose, or just trying to hand-wave the case away.  i can see a million reasons why you'd fire somebody for improper use or equipment or leaving a safety hazard like that laying around, so it's easy enough to say "whoever did it will be fired", then change subjects and mention that you have a zero tolerance policy for harassment, even if it's unrelated to the reasons why you'd fire the person who left the rope out.

0	naruto had always really been a story about basically-wizards, let's be honest. i was cool with the explosion of power as it went on mostly because the fights didnt become caricatures because of it-- it just added a lot of bombast.      bleach is an example of power creep gone to hell. the final (manga) arc of bleach especially devolves into everyone developing 11th hour power ups roughly three times per fight, and the final big bad himself was quite literally impossible to beat without an asspull. (as in, he was revealed to be able to not only see the future, but decide what the future would be, even when dead. completely omnipotent.)

0	i've stopped playing multiplayer games because of the toxicity found in them. it sucks when you love a game but its completely ruined by the people that play it. i don't know if its a reflection of general society, or if the nature of the games attracts rude, unhappy, and all around toxic individuals. i was able to put up with it in the past, but as i get older and have less free time i have less and less patience to deal with the people. most of all, i'm just sad that beautifully crafted games are ruined by assholes.

0	all april fools jokes are stupid...      but as for your main point, no. it's not like he was explicitly making fun of people with fertility issues. he didn't pretend that they miscarried. he pretended that his wife, a biological woman, is pregnant. something that happens to women all the time.       whilst i can sympathise with the struggles, and i do understand that it can be triggering to see other people getting pregnant or having a healthy pregnancy when you can't, it's a bit ridiculous and unfair to take that out on everyone else. it's nobody's fault that some people have fertility issues and demanding that everyone else avoid the subject to make you feel better is silly and frankly selfish.       quit playing victim and build a platform to discuss the issue in a productive and non-aggressive manner.

0	while it is going away, i find people still appreciate it. some old aunt might act offended if you don't send her a thank you card. forget her. if you are sending a card because it is expected of you, then you are sending it for the wrong reason anyway.              on the other hand. when someone gives you a gift and you say thank you in person, you now have the opportunity to double down on a good thing.  almost all mail you get is trash these days, so it's nice when something isn't.             >hi, grandma,     >     >it was great seeing you at the baby shower last week. with the baby on the way i know my life is about to get much more hectic and it was so nice to get to see you before i loose any chance at sleep, hahaha. thank  you so much for the crib i was afraid i would have to keep the baby in a shoe box but this will be so much better. i can't wait until the next time i see you and i hope all is well.     >     >love,     >     >batman      it takes very little time to write one of these and the person who receives it will likely appreciate hearing from you, especially if they are older.  you don't even need to go all out on special cards from hallmark or some shit. regular paper is no less sentimental, which is the whole point.              i'm certainly not saying you should do it. but you might consider looking at it as something you can do that someone who gave you a gift will enjoy, instead of something you *have* to do because your parents or whoever said so.

0	>i really wish we could get to the genesis of the hatred of bigger people.      as with all societal trends it's complicated but i think media plays the most significant role.       movies, tv, advertising... everyone looks a certain way. even non visual mediums like books and radio will *describe* people as having these certain looks.  and heck, you can see this even in how very body-positive overweight people dress/do their makeup.... they're still copying all the styles popularized by people of a more normal weight.       i don't think that makes the body positive overweight people hypocrites though, which people will want to do... instead i think it just shows how unbelievably pervasive media and societal perceptions of beauty really are. even a person claiming to be body positive will have makeup that mimics what you might see on a celebrity.       there is an element of health involved. no doubt, being overweight is generally less healthy... obesity is not the way the human body naturally should end up... but i think that's so buried beneath the cultural elements that i find it generally hard to believe most people when they claim their fat people hate comes from beliefs about health and wellness.          >the average size of americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people i cant wrap my head around.      so i actually have noticed less hatred for fat people in the past 5 years or so, perhaps owing to the increasing size of americans. at this moment, some 2/3rds of americans are overweight or obese.       however, there's also an element one commenter pointed out that is clearly on display in this aita post: self-hate/self-loathing... the overweight girl very likely is quite ashamed and sensitive about her size and is using the sassy, in-your-face body positivity as a cover... and i'm sure that many of the people shitting on fat people online are themselves overweight.           >mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course.      absolutely. especially i think in the sort of middle-range of being bigger... if you're slightly overweight as a guy, it's much more acceptable than being slightly overweight as a girl.

1	in the internet, people ignore the obvious and focus on details that often are not even there and just matter because of an autistic imagined connection between events.      like, if there were 10 people hanging out and somebody told this story, one guy would say "you asked her for a date, she rejected. so you asked another girl. yeah, best possible thing you can do." and the discussion would be over. but online, some idiot writes a thousand word reply why op is an asshole. in real life, nobody even would listen more than two sentences. and the guy would probably realize that he is dumb and just drop it himself after the 3rd sentence.

0	i think i understand what theyre saying. but it shows just how hateful and ignorant they are.      what they mean by "everyone is sad and lonely and this company has been telling them what they want to hear for the last 20 years" is that the games, and franchise as a whole, teach that friendship and companionship are important and help you achieve great things that wouldve been impossible for you to do on your own.      in red ans blue, we're told the reason we keep beating blue is because we treat our pokemon as our friends, while hes only concerned with having the strongest team. he looses because his pokemon dont actually care aboit him because he doesnt show them kindness, while our pokemon go above and beyond because they genuinely dont want to let us down - this is a theme continued in nearly every game in the franchise.         now, heres the sad part. they say this is "the same way the alt right recruits incels" which is partially true.   kind of. theres a grain of truth in it in that its easy to radicalize groups that have been oppressed, mistreated, etc. this is the same basic recruiting tactic that isis uses; they find vulnerable people and promise them that they can be apart of something bigger, something greater, somewhere that they can finally belong. - cults have also been known to use this tactic.      but, instead of looking at that and going "maybe we should treat people better, show them basic human kindness and respect. let them know theyre valued as a person even if they disagree with me" they miss the point and go "pikachu must be a nhazi!!! thats the only possible conclusion!!!"

0	i mean, in a way women are allowed and expected to show emotion but simultaneously people use those emotions to point out how irrational and weak women are. hysteria was used as a way to turn female emotions into a pathology not that long ago and still today people say a female can't be good leaders because their emotions get in the way of decision making and some shit about pms.         at the same time, if women in position of power don't show much emotions and feminine traits, people acuse them of being "too harsh", "too manly" or simply put, a bitch.            women are taught to show emotion and are shamed for it, men are taught to not show emotion and get rewarded for it. yes it is at the cost of their own mental health and that is what the toxic form of masculinity is, but it doesn't mean women have much better.

0	i've been considering the neoluddite position recently, and i'm not sure i'm convinced. abandoning technologies because we don't like what they do to us is a principled position, sure, but it's not a winning position. those who abandon the efficiency monster are subjugated and subsequently die out.      still, it seems like critique can only take us so far - we can reveal the man behind the curtain - expose the system for what it *really is,* but once we become the architects of a new system, it is subject to the exact same process of critique. this does seem preferable to dying out, but it seems disconcerting to most people - to propose any new system is to presuppose a notion of what is good, but to acknowledge that the system might one day be overturned is to acknowledge that one's conception of the good is ultimately subjective hogwash.      personally, i've been turning more towards theologians to find an answer to the problem, but your mileage may vary.

0	its not because of corrupt governments (okay some of it is) but the vast vast vast majority of the problem is that the people trying to help do not understand economics.      we ship food, we ship mosquito nets and medicine to these poor places. but how do the locals compete with a product that is free? if i want to manufacture mosquito nets and sell them, who will buy my product when they are being given out for free? if i'm a farmer, how do i sell my crop, when the market is being flooded with free food? we are putting locals out of business. we are creating welfare dependents and then, most insidiously, we change the amount being given year by year. we destroy industries and then cut aid a few years later leaving people to starve and die of malaria.      if we wanted to actually help, we would build industries in those places and create jobs so that they can support themselves instead of being reliant on aid. if anyone who reads this wants to help poorer countries, [URL] groups together microloans for 3rd world countries. it helps far more than throwing free goods and services at them, and the majority of loans are repaid so your donation (loan) is very likely to get returned to you so you can loan it again.

0	i believe this is a valid option.  either way something get's inflated - the asset market or the physical market that we drop money from helicopters on.  the idea that all new debt created by central banks has landed in asset markets is also a bit oversimplified.  the fed ultimately supports the us govt's overspending.  there have been helicopters dropping cash onto universities (govt backed student loans) and healthcare (medicare, medicaid, obama care, expansion of benefits to illegal immigrants, etc......).  bottom line is that we also saw prices for both healthcare and college tuition skyrocket over the last 10+ years due to mmt in action without any corresponding increase in supply.  with unlimited $$'s being thrown at colleges and healthcare - prices have only moved in one direction.

0	the massacre at columbine high school took place on april 20, 1999. astonishingly, for eight days after the tragedy, during thousands of hours of prime-time television coverage, virtually no one mentioned the word "drugs." then the issue was opened. eric harris, one of the shooters at columbine, was on at least one drug.      the ny times of april 29, 1999, and other papers reported that harris was rejected from enlisting in the marines for medical reasons. a friend of the family told the times that harris was being treated by a psychiatrist. and then several sources told the washington post that the drug prescribed as treatment was luvox, manufactured by solvay.      in two more days, the "drug-issue" was gone.      luvox is of the same class as prozac and zoloft and paxil. they are labeled ssris (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). they attempt to alleviate depression by changing brain-levels of the natural substance serotonin. luvox has a slightly different chemical configuration from prozac, paxil, and zoloft, and it was approved by the fda for obsessive-compulsive disorder, although many doctors apparently prescribe it for depression.      prozac is the wildly popular eli lilly antidepressant which has been linked to suicidal and homicidal actions. it is now given to young children. again, its chemical composition is very close to luvox, the drug that harris took.      dr. peter breggin, the eminent psychiatrist and author (toxic psychiatry, talking back to prozac, talking back to ritalin), told me, "with luvox there is some evidence of a four-percent rate for mania in adolescents. mania, for certain individuals, could be a component in grandiose plans to destroy large numbers of other people. mania can go over the hill to psychosis."      dr. joseph tarantolo is a psychiatrist in private practice in washington dc. he is the president of the washington chapter of the american society of psychoanalytic physicians. tarantolo states that "all the ssris [including prozac and luvox] relieve the patient of feeling. he becomes less empathic, as in `i don't care as much,' which means `it's easier for me to harm you.' if a doctor treats someone who needs a great deal of strength just to think straight, and gives him one of these drugs, that could push him over the edge into violent behavior."      in arianna huffington's syndicated newspaper column of july 9, 1998, dr. breggin states, "i have no doubt that prozac can cause or contribute to violence and suicide. i've seen many cases. in a recent clinical trial, 6 percent of the children became psychotic on prozac. and manic psychosis can lead to violence."      a study from the september 1989 journal of clinical psychiatry, by joseph lipiniski, jr., indicates that in five examined cases people on prozac developed what is called akathesia. symptoms include intense anxiety, inability to sleep, the "jerking of extremities," and "bicycling in bed or just turning around and around." dr. breggin comments that akathesia "may also contribute to the drug's tendency to cause self-destructive or violent tendencies ... akathesia can become the equivalent of biochemical torture and could possibly tip someone over the edge into self-destructive or violent behavior ... the june 1990 health newsletter, produced by the public citizen research group, reports, 'akathesia, or symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, and purposeless movements of the feet and legs, may occur in 10-25 percent of patients on prozac.'"      other studies:      "emergence of self-destructive phenomena in children and adolescents during fluoxetine [prozac] treatment," published in the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry (1991, vol.30), written by ra king, ra riddle, et al. it reports self-destructive phenomena in 14% (6/42) of children and adolescents (10-17 years old) who had treatment with fluoxetine (prozac) for obsessive-compulsive disorder.      july, 1991. journal of child and adolescent psychiatry. hisako koizumi, md, describes a thirteen-year-old boy who was on prozac: "full of energy," "hyperactive," "clown-like." all this devolved into sudden violent actions which were "totally unlike him."      september, 1991. the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry. author laurence jerome reports the case of a ten-year old who moves with his family to a new location. becoming depressed, the boy is put on prozac by a doctor. the boy is then "hyperactive, agitated ... irritable." he makes a "somewhat grandiose assessment of his own abilities." then he calls a stranger on the phone and says he is going to kill him. the prozac is stopped, and the symptoms disappear.      the well-known goodman and gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics reveals a strange fact. it states that ritalin [given for adhd] is "structurally related to amphetamines ... its pharmacological properties are essentially the same as those of the amphetamines." in other words, the only clear difference is legality. and the effects, in layman's terms, are obvious. you take speed and, sooner or later, you start crashing. you become agitated, irritable, paranoid, delusional, aggressive.      in his book, toxic psychiatry, dr. breggin discusses the subject of drug combinations: "combining antidepressants [e.g., prozac, luvox, paxil] and psychostimulants [e.g., ritalin] increases the risk of cardiovascular catastrophe, seizures, sedation, euphoria, and psychosis. withdrawal from the combination can cause a severe reaction that includes confusion, emotional instability, agitation, and aggression." children are frequently medicated with this combination, and when we highlight such effects as aggression, psychosis, and emotional instability, it is obvious that the result is pointing toward the very real possibility of violence.      in 1986, the international journal of the addictions published a most important literature review by richard scarnati. it was titled, "an outline of hazardous side effects of ritalin (methylphenidate)" [v.21(7), pp. 837-841].      scarnati listed over a hundred adverse affects of ritalin and indexed published journal articles for each of these symptoms.

0	> if someone wants to take the risk and go helmetless, knowing what they are getting themselves into, they should have the right to make that choice - even if i don't personally agree with the merits of it.      a factor that people like this forget is that wrecklessly endangering yourself doesn't just increase the risk of injury and death, it wastes medical resources as well.      emts are often overworked and rushing to get from one emergency to another. by not wearing a seatbelt or helmet, a minor accident potentially goes from something you walk away from to something where emts have to lose time trying to stabilise and/or resuscitate you. this being time in which they might not be able to attend to people who got hurt for non-moronic reasons, read: not because they were too stubborn to take basic safety precautions.

0	i've been considering the neoluddite position recently, and i'm not sure i'm convinced. abandoning technologies because we don't like what they do to us is a principled position, sure, but it's not a winning position. those who abandon the efficiency monster are subjugated and subsequently die out.      still, it seems like critique can only take us so far - we can reveal the man behind the curtain - expose the system for what it *really is,* but once we become the architects of a new system, it is subject to the exact same process of critique. this does seem preferable to dying out, but it seems disconcerting to most people - to propose any new system is to presuppose a notion of what is good, but to acknowledge that the system might one day be overturned is to acknowledge that one's conception of the good is ultimately subjective hogwash.      personally, i've been turning more towards theologians to find an answer to the problem, but your mileage may vary.

0	but why put all these souls through torture though? spiritual test, for what? and why?         ive done enough psychadelics to see that we're all just infinite light and like you say that this is just a playground to elevate your consciousness but for what purpose really.               also if we're infinite then the earth realm is probably infinite aswell, this current style of life might change or end but we will probably be back here again.         i dont believe in religion cause people are greedy and they will intervene if they see things are powerful i.e for control but the idea of god(as in energy or light not a bearded guy in the sky) is growing on me.         if anything buddhism seems fairly reasonable.

0	>i really wish we could get to the genesis of the hatred of bigger people.      as with all societal trends it's complicated but i think media plays the most significant role.       movies, tv, advertising... everyone looks a certain way. even non visual mediums like books and radio will *describe* people as having these certain looks.  and heck, you can see this even in how very body-positive overweight people dress/do their makeup.... they're still copying all the styles popularized by people of a more normal weight.       i don't think that makes the body positive overweight people hypocrites though, which people will want to do... instead i think it just shows how unbelievably pervasive media and societal perceptions of beauty really are. even a person claiming to be body positive will have makeup that mimics what you might see on a celebrity.       there is an element of health involved. no doubt, being overweight is generally less healthy... obesity is not the way the human body naturally should end up... but i think that's so buried beneath the cultural elements that i find it generally hard to believe most people when they claim their fat people hate comes from beliefs about health and wellness.          >the average size of americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people i cant wrap my head around.      so i actually have noticed less hatred for fat people in the past 5 years or so, perhaps owing to the increasing size of americans. at this moment, some 2/3rds of americans are overweight or obese.       however, there's also an element one commenter pointed out that is clearly on display in this aita post: self-hate/self-loathing... the overweight girl very likely is quite ashamed and sensitive about her size and is using the sassy, in-your-face body positivity as a cover... and i'm sure that many of the people shitting on fat people online are themselves overweight.           >mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course.      absolutely. especially i think in the sort of middle-range of being bigger... if you're slightly overweight as a guy, it's much more acceptable than being slightly overweight as a girl.

0	chesterfield county, va. (wric) — a chesterfield family spoke with 8news friday after fending off a naked intruder who broke into their home on south twilight lane the night before. the intruder claimed to be the devil and attacked the family, prompting the homeowner to fire 39 rounds.      the incident was a traumatic experience for the lewis family's first night in their brand new home.         "she was in to kill us," melissa lewis said. "that was her almighty, to kill us. she attacked us and i held her down just kept on punching her and punching her as hard as i possibly could."      the lewis' dream home now looks like a war zone, with blood soaked into the carpet, the walls and windows riddled with bullets and shell casings scattered all over.      "i said 'who are you?" lewis' husband, who did not wish to go on camera, explained. "she said 'i need your help, please help me.' i said 'get out of my house,' and she goes 'i'm the devil.'"         the homeowner says the woman, who had a blue ponytail, broke into the basement around 10:30 p.m. on july 4. the family said she was laughing menacingly and refused to leave.      "she looked possessed, her eyes were completely black, like saucers, and she was laughing like it was a joke," lewis's husband told 8news.      fearing for his life, the father of three grabbed his pistol and gave a verbal warning to the woman. with his family sleeping upstairs, he opened fire hoping to scare her off. none of the shots struck the suspect.      lewis said the woman aggressively charged at him with superhuman strength.      "she was not stopping," he said. "she had the strength of four grown men."      when he ran out of bullets, lewis began throwing furniture at her. his wife and children eventually jumped in and attempted to stop the woman. the intruder didn't stop until one of the children, the lewis' 12-year-old son logan, shoved a wrench into her neck.         police arrested the intruder and she is being treated and evaluated at the hospital. the lewis family left with bruises and bite marks.      "i'm scared to go in there, i won't even go into any room by myself, i'm terrified," m. lewis said.      detectives told the family that the suspect lives nearby and will eventually be charged robbery, breaking and entering and attempted murder. she is currently in the icu with severe head trauma.

0	a lot of the horribleness going on right now, both internally in the individual and on the external micro and macro levels, fit the prohecies about the kali yuga very well: [URL]      i don't remember the textual basis for the specific explanations about the history of the gradual decline of the human form found in buddhism.      i obviously don't know from direct personal experience or empiricism that the following is correct, but now i feel like digging more.      the teachings i received on that topic states (iirc) that we've gone through what we might call a gradual grossification.      in the distant past humans didn't possess solid bodies, but were "light beings," living thousands of years.      at a later stage in the process of degradation, humans were giants, still with a life-span many times that which we're used to now.      it's kinda interesting in that context, that we've been finding skeletons of giants here and there.      we've slowly declined since then. we become more easily diseased, we increasingly ignore the suffering of our fellow beings, we have a very hard time questioning our persistent illusion (as einstein called it) of dualism and physicalism (which i think lay at the basis of our ethical decline), and it's getting worse.      according to the buddhist master i heard talk about it, the pollution of our environment is one mechanism by which the degradation will continue to worsen, until we reach the point where we're literal gnomes living no more than 10 years.      our ethical and spiritual virtues, our true nature of boundless wisdom and kindness, will be increasingly inaccessible to us, velied behind thickening layers of delusion and ignorance.      it is said that when the dharma (a complex word, but in this case it refers to the teachings that lead to liberation) is completely gone from the world and forgotten by men, we will have reached the end of the kali yuga, after which the fourth buddha, maitreya (who is, curiously, unlike most buddhas, always portrayed sitting on a chair) will appear.      interestingly, maitraya will teach only the basic vehicle of liberation, known as the theravada/hinayana ("way of the elders" or something like that, and "small vehicle" respectively), whereas the current buddha, shakyamuni, who appeared 2500 years ago, also taught the mahayana (great vehicle), the vajrayana (diamond or thunderbolt vehicle), mantrayana, mahamudra and dzogchen. [edit: the latter four classes of teachings mentioned were in most cases not given through what could be called conventional means and not necessarily during the life time of the buddha. adherents of the theravada/hinayana schools will tell you that only the pali canon truly came from buddha. conversely, the higher schools will always include the teachings of the theravada/hinayana, which are a prequisite, beginning  with the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path.)      the reason for that, is that the buddha knew about the kali yuga: how full of disturbing emotions we'd become, and how much suffering we would experience.      the mahayana is the path of the bodhisattva, and along with the hinayana it's prequisite for the practice of the higher vehicles, such as  vajrayana, which is the vehicle of transformation.      knowing we would have a lot of disturbing emotions and suffering, providing the teachings that allow for the transformation of that into fuel on the path to liberation, was important.      there's so much to say about this and so many interesting little nuggest to be found in the wisdom traditions of the east.      again, i don't know any of this to be true, and my basis for the above is almost completely an appeal to authority.      i'm going to delve more into the topic. i'll probably post the write-up on r/psychonaut rather than here though :)      edit: spelling + a few details.

0	the most important argument i emphasize is that sanders is a political candidate just like everyone else.      it's crazy how so many americans (particularly young voters) thought and still think he's some sort of pure newcomer that doesn't have the problems that other presidential candidates do. they say he's not corrupt, represents the working class, truly connects to people, and would bring sweeping changes such as large taxes on the one percent and free college.       in reality, sanders is irresponsible, lacks the pragmatic ability to put ideas into practice, and has remained grossly over-simplistic on the economy, race, international affairs, and other issues. his personal history speaks volumes to his ineptitude as a candidate. in particular, his lack of significant work to show his commitment to politics and the country.       his actions are self-centered (e.g., continuing to campaign when he had no chance of winning and continuing internal strife within the democratic party, etc.), immature (e.g., as though every thing that happened in the country was primarily some sort of rigged, systematic injustice carried out by elitist individuals who control everything. and, seriously, "feel the bern?" is your campaign slogan? not to mention all the ridiculous memes portraying him this way. because everyone knows memes are well-justified, valid arguments about knowledge.), and in many ways more dangerous than trump's actions, in my opinion. and he's a socialist. i'm not voting for a socialist.      the primary reason why he didn't face much opposition was because the republican party and republican citizens generally wanted to stir conflict between sanders and clinton (so they didn't want to give clinton ammo), and that they would save much of their attack for the general election against clinton herself.

0	so which rule did he violate internet people:      if you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action.      rule 0: be civil   let's keep the talk and discussion on what ever the subject matter of the post may be. resorting to personal quarrels and arguments that may use insults and other tribal-like behaviors will be deleted. keep it civil.      rule 1: correct formatting   the requirements for posting to this subreddit is to have a self contained opinion within the title. the text will be used to expand and elaborate on why you think/feel this way. you may also include why you think this is an unpopular or controversial opinion.      rule 2: opinion must be unpopular/controversial   this sub isn't just opinions, but unpopular and/or controversial ones. if your opinion has been posted to the subreddit recently, chances are it'll get removed. so please search before submitting.      rule 3: no reposts/search before submitting   if essentially the same opinion gets reposted it'll automatically mean it's not an unpopular opinion (within the context of the sub). it will get removed. if your opinion is about a ongoing event, there will usually be a mega thread where you can discuss there.      rule 4: no spam   new accounts are subject to a 24 hour waiting period before posting. spamming will usually result to a perma ban.      rule 5: no trolling   trolling is saying random unsolicited things that only serve to invoke a knee jerk reaction. trolls will usually get permanently banned.      rule 6: elaborate   an important rule in this subreddit is that all opinions must be elaborated on. there is a discussion to be had, so please expand on what you have said.   your post must contain more than 160 characters (roughly two or three standard sentences) to avoid auto-deletion by automod.      rule 7: hate posts are not allowed   opinion can be unpopular unless it's blatantly a hateful post. hostile, rude and aggressive behavior is not a necessity to express your opinion. please be civil and and have respect. bear in mind that justifying or endorsing pedophilia activities (sidenote: discussion on treatments of the mental health itself is fine), rape, race issues, assault or other similar crimes will usually count as hate speech. this does not mean you'll get banned for saying one crime is not as severe as another or saying you can understand why someone would commit a crime. race baiting is a ban-able offence      rule 8: no low effort/satire posts   any opinion that is not thought out well or posts that clearly have very little effort put into them will be removed. this also includes commonly posted opinions to the subreddit. please note that obscure topics and meta commentaries on the subreddit do not constitute a valid unpopular opinion post."

0	men are much more shamed in media for doing 'girly' things than when girls do 'manly' things. (wife-fu tv trope ring a bell?)   our male-guided society simply considers masculine preferable to feminine. again, this is very general, and i'm not like implying that trans men have a walk in the park or anything, but they do get a fraction of ridicule and negative attention that trans women get, and i think there's a reason for that. but that's another can of worms
0	it's true. the primary benefactors of these movements are predatory men.              and the trans movement believes in a feminine essence theory, which doesn't jell with many feminists.

0	i have a dark sense of humour. i never really make jokes about gays, though.       i mean, i'm sure i've made a joke aimed at a gay man before, but the focus of the humour wasn't in any way related to his sexuality.      my jokes mostly rely on dead baby humour, being a serial killer, or cannibalism (though i hate that word. i prefer to think of myself as a humanitarian). it's not about killing gays, or hating *anyone,* it's about being hungry.      the only group i specifically target is vegetarians and vegans, because they eat what food eats, therefore by the transitive property, they are food. that's not hate, that's just math.

1	in the internet, people ignore the obvious and focus on details that often are not even there and just matter because of an autistic imagined connection between events.      like, if there were 10 people hanging out and somebody told this story, one guy would say "you asked her for a date, she rejected. so you asked another girl. yeah, best possible thing you can do." and the discussion would be over. but online, some idiot writes a thousand word reply why op is an asshole. in real life, nobody even would listen more than two sentences. and the guy would probably realize that he is dumb and just drop it himself after the 3rd sentence.

0	chesterfield county, va. (wric) — a chesterfield family spoke with 8news friday after fending off a naked intruder who broke into their home on south twilight lane the night before. the intruder claimed to be the devil and attacked the family, prompting the homeowner to fire 39 rounds.      the incident was a traumatic experience for the lewis family's first night in their brand new home.         "she was in to kill us," melissa lewis said. "that was her almighty, to kill us. she attacked us and i held her down just kept on punching her and punching her as hard as i possibly could."      the lewis' dream home now looks like a war zone, with blood soaked into the carpet, the walls and windows riddled with bullets and shell casings scattered all over.      "i said 'who are you?" lewis' husband, who did not wish to go on camera, explained. "she said 'i need your help, please help me.' i said 'get out of my house,' and she goes 'i'm the devil.'"         the homeowner says the woman, who had a blue ponytail, broke into the basement around 10:30 p.m. on july 4. the family said she was laughing menacingly and refused to leave.      "she looked possessed, her eyes were completely black, like saucers, and she was laughing like it was a joke," lewis's husband told 8news.      fearing for his life, the father of three grabbed his pistol and gave a verbal warning to the woman. with his family sleeping upstairs, he opened fire hoping to scare her off. none of the shots struck the suspect.      lewis said the woman aggressively charged at him with superhuman strength.      "she was not stopping," he said. "she had the strength of four grown men."      when he ran out of bullets, lewis began throwing furniture at her. his wife and children eventually jumped in and attempted to stop the woman. the intruder didn't stop until one of the children, the lewis' 12-year-old son logan, shoved a wrench into her neck.         police arrested the intruder and she is being treated and evaluated at the hospital. the lewis family left with bruises and bite marks.      "i'm scared to go in there, i won't even go into any room by myself, i'm terrified," m. lewis said.      detectives told the family that the suspect lives nearby and will eventually be charged robbery, breaking and entering and attempted murder. she is currently in the icu with severe head trauma.

0	i've got some questions for you.      - **how old is your child?**      - **is your child the 1 most important thing in the world to you?**      - **do you still love this woman?** (i'd be surprised if you didn't).      these are the important things you need to answer to understand and make a proper decision on what to do from here on. being cheated on is a dreadful thing to experience but since there's a child involved here, hasty moves or bad decisions will affect the child more than it will affect you or her.      you don't have to give me the answers but at the very least, answer them for yourself and remember that your child is the most important thing to think about right now.       if your child is under 18, a divorce won't wreck the child's life but it'll turn their world upside down quite a bit. likewise, if you stay together, i can see the resentment building up and cause marital issues at home and if the child is present while they take place, it'll affect them badly as well.      you have financial problems as well that could come out of a divorce. you'll have to pay child support (likely). alimony is another problem you'll (probably) encounter. you'll have less say in your child's life if your child chooses to live with the mother. you won't get to see the child as much as much.       if you still love her then this makes this whole thing ten times harder than it already is. you can't help it but it's really not going to help you either. she might cheat on you again, she may even be cheating on you right now with a new person and you wouldn't even know it.      if you still have concerns about her cheating on you again, what would be the best course of action is to "separate" but only in your relationship and not your marriage. this is so the child gets the best benefit out of this. you're both still married, you live in the same house, you both take care of the kid but you're no longer "together".      that way, if she decides to cheat on you again, it won't cause any issues. you'll also be free to seek other women as well for your own benefit as well. and once the child reaches the age of 18 (or until the child moves out), you can decide to divorce her and forget about her.      but if you feel you can actually work it out properly and still have a proper relationship then you should try to do just that. it's down to your judgement ultimately. just remember, there's absolutely no reason why she wouldn't cheat again. she managed to hide this one from you for four years and you couldn't do a thing about it. *she had to tell you* and it was only because she couldn't handle the guilt anymore and even then, it was because she felt sorry for herself and not you.      i have to tell you, i'd be paranoid all the time. every single time she went out and came home late, "*is she fucking another guy again?*" every time she's on the phone, "*is she texting another guy? what are they talking about?*" every time she acts weird, down or strange, "*is she feeling guilty because she fucked another guy again?*"      or she doesn't want sex with you, "*did she already have sex with another guy? has she been cheating again?*" this is but a taste of what it feels like being with a person that has admitted to cheating on you. it's mental torture of insecurity, paranoia and heartbreak and you'll hate every second of it.      jesus, it'd be pretty bad, so do it how you want to do it but make sure the child doesn't get punished for it. look after your own mental health as well and don't brutalize or mentally torture your wife either.      if you're feeling angry or sad, don't make any decisions until the feeling passes.       i wish you good luck, bud.

0	while it is going away, i find people still appreciate it. some old aunt might act offended if you don't send her a thank you card. forget her. if you are sending a card because it is expected of you, then you are sending it for the wrong reason anyway.              on the other hand. when someone gives you a gift and you say thank you in person, you now have the opportunity to double down on a good thing.  almost all mail you get is trash these days, so it's nice when something isn't.             >hi, grandma,     >     >it was great seeing you at the baby shower last week. with the baby on the way i know my life is about to get much more hectic and it was so nice to get to see you before i loose any chance at sleep, hahaha. thank  you so much for the crib i was afraid i would have to keep the baby in a shoe box but this will be so much better. i can't wait until the next time i see you and i hope all is well.     >     >love,     >     >batman      it takes very little time to write one of these and the person who receives it will likely appreciate hearing from you, especially if they are older.  you don't even need to go all out on special cards from hallmark or some shit. regular paper is no less sentimental, which is the whole point.              i'm certainly not saying you should do it. but you might consider looking at it as something you can do that someone who gave you a gift will enjoy, instead of something you *have* to do because your parents or whoever said so.

0	depending on where you live on the globe the minimum is 3 male, female, and intersex. these of course correspond with the the biological sexes. some countries have  separated intersex as a sexual identity and gender identity. in those areas the correct terms are gender queer or gender diverse.      some regions count up to 51 different gender identity variations if my memory is correct but many of those are highly disputed.

0	porn is a separate realm of its own and often uses things that might be seen harmful for the enjoyment of both the viewer and the performer, so i'm not going to dig into that. but in media, even if the character is male identifying, the term trap still suggests malevolence. in addition, the difference from trans women isn't always clear, so the audience could connect the term to them even if that's not the purpose. terms like crossdresser or even transvestite seem much better to me.

0	don't know if your still searching the job market but:      i was kind of in a similar situation to yours. got rejected from a 3d art school, and they pretty much took anyone so i felt like shit. at that point i had also been looking for employment for more than a year and i just kept getting rejected/no answer.      i eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (artella.com). this was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. at this point i was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc.       getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, i really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most vfx houses). someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/vfx.      you tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. i was fully aware of that when i was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. but i wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. sure there are people that grow out it, but i've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years.      keep improving, keep applying, and approach recruiters on linkedin informally, have chats with them about future opportunities. they're a lot more friendly than most people realize ;)       best of luck.

0	well i identified that way from about age 14-16. i never would have if i hadn't been on tumblr. i'm designated female at birth, and i never liked being a girl, mainly because of the way our society and past societies have treated women. also, i was always a bit of a "tom boy." so i thought the label "genderfluid" fit what i was going through. some days, i would feel masculine, and some days i would feel feminine and want to be perceived as such. i now realize those feelings were probably a result of me going through puberty.       side note: i also identified as asexual when i was 14. i think this is really messed up, as most 14-year-olds are too young to think about sex, yet being on tumblr and seeing that culture told me it was ok to identify that way and i wasn't too young to know i was asexual. it turns out i was just a lesbian with repressed feelings.      originally i decided to stop identifying as genderfluid because i started dating and i didn't feel like i could adequately explain it on a dating website (yes really), so i thought "if i'm not serious enough about this to explain it to someone i might date in the future, what's the point," so now i just identify as female.       this is now why i am so against tumblr identity politics. it's really messed up to see these kids go through what i had to go through because they were impressionable and misinformed. i've seen plenty of people who used to identify as "demiromantic lithrosexual bigender" when it turned out they were just gay or trans or even bisexual but they were young and wanted labels and didn't quite understand what they were going through. tumblr encourages this and shames people who disagree even though it's toxic and can set people who actually want to find an identity back a good 2 years.       tldr labels bad tumblr bad puberty and repressed lesbian feelings

0	every day coming back from my new school to my room,  i can't do anything except being alone with my mind... i grew up in a child care home when my parents left me there. i was about 5yrs old there, and now more than one year, being 19yrs old, i dont want what to do with my life, i feel so lonely, haven't felt parents love and i really feel empty inside... but i still want love so badly... even if i go suicide myself, no one would notice that, because no one cares about me for sure...  but i can't  do that to myself, i wouldn't dare, cuz i feel that im too strong from inside and outside.. i just want to say that i feel very bad every day, i dont know what to do with my life, i want that someone would care about me.. my english is bad but i hope u will understand me. thanks
0	no idea! they love discussing whether they took their husband's last names for some reason.
0	no, it's sexist to go on a lines of code counting crusade (the dumbest, most meaningless metric to measure contribution in any code project) and trolling spree to try and discredit a woman who happened to be getting a lot of attention for her role on the project.

0	>i brought up profit margins because i'm pretty sure that's what the parent comment in this thread meant but didn't express it properly.      they were basically arguing about two different things the whole time...       though the linked article was kinda vague and simplistic and had no business declaring the myth busted or whatever.
0	yes you're kinda dumb. jesus how much evil does someone need to do to you before you take a stand. she betrayed your trust, broke her vows, tells you about this years after the kids are born so she's been able to milk you for support. now in a divorce you have child support and been together long enough for alimony. cheating isn't a mistake, it's a long series of choices that do irreparable damage. she did not care about you at all then, and she continued the lie each day she didn't tell you, robbing you of the opportunity to leave before conceiving a child and finding another more suitable  partner.      now you're older, have a kid, and she tells you since leaving would suck just as much as staying a blowing this off as just some mistake she made years ago.
0	i always wondered where we white latinos place in the oppression pyramid.      ...do they even know we exist?
0	you were their hero, and i'll never be able to explain to them why you didn't think i was worth loving, and why they were so easy for you to use as pawns against me. i'll never be able to explain how broken you are, and that it wasn't them, and isn't me that made you do what it is you are doing to them. we're all broken in this world. we are all screwed up. the only thing that distinguishes us from one another is that some of us are brave enough to try and face who we are, in order to change for the better. i'll never be able to make them not hurt when they think about you. you won't ever be able to undo what pain you caused them, and me, out of your own fear and desperation to heal yourself. you can find a new wife, and take new kids under your wing. you can get that education degree, and lead the youth of the world. you can be everyone else's hero in the whole world. you can blame me for all of it, you can justify every action, but you won't *ever* escape the demons that haunt you. the ones in your heart that get louder any time you allow the anger to fade. the ones that will always remind you that there are 2 children who you failed. the 2 that were your favorite on this earth. the 2 who believed you were their hero in life, that trusted you implicitly, who *knew* you'd always put them first. you shattered their hearts, and changed their lives forever. it won't matter how many more you help. you failed the ones who would have been there for you forever. the 2 that mattered most to you. you will always know what horrors you are capable of carrying out, so you will forever doubt if you can ever do better. you will always know that you used your own children as weapons to hurt a person who never meant to hurt you. a person you loved. you may tell yourself lies on the surface, you may convince yourself that you did the best you could.... but you will *know.* everything you achieve, every commendation you receive, every time a person sings your praises, it will be overshadowed by your regret. because underneath all those justifications, lies a little boy who is terrified of what he has become.

0	steve irwin was a lovely person, but he took some risks that were a little unnecessary.  this sadly lead to his death.  however it is everyone's right to live as they want to some extent, and while his methods of approaching and handling wildlife are far from advisable, he didn't do any harm to animals and he did further our understanding of them.      every science needs a little crazy in the mix; it's just sad when they lose their life doing something preventable.  it's just not the best idea to fuck with dangerous wild animals.
0	it amazes me how much they pride themselves on things they then criticize the right for.       the left shows pictures of their diverse field of staff and are proud of the strength of diversity.      the right does the same damn thing and it's some how bad? token?      it's just further proof that literally not matter what the right does it will never, ever be good enough and they will always look down on them...
0	they used to. religious people figured it was sinful if you tugged or poked more than twice in the shower.      personally, i think it'd be a good idea for girls to get familiar with themselves more. a lot of women report not even having their first actual orgasms until their 20s, masturbation would help with that.
0	cool, go tell them that on posts that you find hateful.
1	my theory is it's her room but this or another guy has been crashing with her for a while and slowly started bringing a lot of his shit over. like the ps4 (hence the chair it's on) and the tire.      i grew up around white trash, i've seen plenty of rooms like that, and the people that live in them, none of it surprises me. frankly, this is tame.

0	very few people actually gave a shit, but everyone loves to be outraged so the people outraged at the ad were paraded on tv and online as the majority, so then people were outraged at that, which then outraged more people and it became a whole issue.       i thought it was a dumb ad that failed to spread the message it was going for because it was just over the top cheese, that's about it from me lol

0	it isn't valid because the those things listed in the op (and your tacked on argument) are reported on in the media as they occur. and each individual person is able to decide if the event impacts them at a personal level.                 unless you think the millions of people are saddened because the media tells us to be.      not saying there would be as wide spread sorrow through the western world if the hagia sophia was destroyed but it would be news, it would be a devastating blow to humanity, and there would be mourning.
0	how?      so far today we've got drama about a bunch of white af mods at bpt insisting people verify their race, a gaming community's mods being paid off by a gaming company and cross-spectrum idiocy from every mod who thinks they have a political barrow to push. i fail to see how this sort of crap has ever helped a community. if it keeps up, reddit exists only until a viable alternative springs up -- then it goes the way of napster.

0	any citations for this the explanation of mitsuhide's betrayal? as far as i knew, no one knows the reason and whether it was the treaty, oda simply calling him names, or fear he was being supplanted as an important general (or other factors).      the massacre at mt. hiei was brutal, but nobunaga was trying to break the militancy of the buddhist monks  (sansom has a good thorough line about this in his three volume history). buddhist monks through much of japanese history were a large, well-armed faction that caused problems for both the court in kyoto and for daimyo. without crushing them to the roots, its likely they would have continued causing problems for those groups.

0	today wasn't terrible.  i suppose that would hinge on your definition of terrible.  at any rate, i happened upon an article.  ronda rousey is helping set up a suicide prevention center or something.  something like that.  as i read through the article, i came to learn that her father and grandfather committed suicide.      i appreciate the kind thought and i don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going.      how stupid do you think i am?  do you think i don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  do you think that i'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'?      it's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, i don't take too kindly to being told that i don't have the right to commit suicide.  i don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when i am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide.      why is it that when i get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is "get help."?  what do you think this help is going to give me that i haven't already experienced?  it'll give me more goddamn bills and i'll get somebody on the phone asking me if i want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy.      i know how to fight this.  the reason that i'm sitting here typing this is all the proof i need.      when i see these anti-suicide things, i just feel so irked.  the only time you give a fuck about me is when i'm in a suicidal mindset.  beside that, i'm just a blank face.  a mere statistic.      believe me.  seriously.  believe me.  i'm not yanking your chain.  i know how bad suicide is.  you don't need to remind me of that.      i can't stop you from trying to prevent suicide, but i can state my opinion and so, i have.

0	this is mostly just for my peace of mind but here goes.      a few years ago i met a girl, we'll call her margo, who was amazing in a million ways.  she was musical, beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent, and she was not my wife.        while my marriage was on the rocks at the time, and my wife wasn't around very much, we were still married.  it was a very dark time for me, but margo was like a massive light that enveloped me and reminded me of who i was.      i think it's worth mentioning that margo and i never slept together, however we absolutely developed real, and deep feelings for each other.      anyway, eventually my wife finds out i've been connecting with margo, and is (rightfully) furious.  there were a few tear filled nights, and some very hard conversations, but in the end, we decided to work things out.  i unceremoniously, (and with much difficulty and hesitation) ended contact with margo.  i still feel horrible about how this all happened because she really was an amazing person who didn't deserve any of the drama i brought upon her.      so, my wife and i work things out, and things are better than they've ever been between us.  we re-found the love we had somehow lost, and are stronger because of everything that happened.  that being said, there was still always a part of me that was just.... empty and regretful.  not because of how things turned out but because of the way they happened.  i was also worried about margo, because for a long time i was her sounding board, and now, i couldn't help her.      tonight i randomly decided to google margo, and there was a video of her singing a brand new song, and parts of it were too specific to not be about what happened between us, but it gave me closure that everything is alright now.      it's late and i'm tired but happy. even though this is a throwaway account i'm hoping this post just gets buried in the "new" pile. this was more for me than anything, because i don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff, and posting it here feels like talking about it.  if you read this far, congratulations determined reader.      tl;dr   not really interesting.
0	no, the mods of that sub just hate the sub

0	if she were all of those things except she had republican policies, then republicans would love her. it's actually that simple, because they just care about her ideas.      meanwhile, if she were a republican, the people on the left holding her up would probably refuse to call her 3 out of 5 of those things and claim she doesn't represent the last two all of a sudden.      evidence of their delusion when waaaay down at the bottom of the thread, someone points out that the right-wing likes candace owens so this theory makes no sense. someone responds with:      > tokenism?      so they hate aoc because she's 'poc', but they love candace owens because she's 'poc'.

0	any citations for this the explanation of mitsuhide's betrayal? as far as i knew, no one knows the reason and whether it was the treaty, oda simply calling him names, or fear he was being supplanted as an important general (or other factors).      the massacre at mt. hiei was brutal, but nobunaga was trying to break the militancy of the buddhist monks  (sansom has a good thorough line about this in his three volume history). buddhist monks through much of japanese history were a large, well-armed faction that caused problems for both the court in kyoto and for daimyo. without crushing them to the roots, its likely they would have continued causing problems for those groups.
0	these people are npcs who eat up the carefully curated cnn narrative of the idiot hick trump supporter.      most of my friends and family are urban-dwelling educated professionals who make bank, give to their communities and love trump, and who these nitwits have no idea are standing next to them at farmer's markets and yoga studios.       i have a buddy who looks every bit the pacific northwest liberal but is by far the most based gun-toting libertarian conservative type i have ever met, and is a fucking genius at everything he tries. he is basically undefeated at debate, certainly when talking to libs.

0	today wasn't terrible.  i suppose that would hinge on your definition of terrible.  at any rate, i happened upon an article.  ronda rousey is helping set up a suicide prevention center or something.  something like that.  as i read through the article, i came to learn that her father and grandfather committed suicide.      i appreciate the kind thought and i don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going.      how stupid do you think i am?  do you think i don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  do you think that i'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'?      it's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, i don't take too kindly to being told that i don't have the right to commit suicide.  i don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when i am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide.      why is it that when i get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is "get help."?  what do you think this help is going to give me that i haven't already experienced?  it'll give me more goddamn bills and i'll get somebody on the phone asking me if i want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy.      i know how to fight this.  the reason that i'm sitting here typing this is all the proof i need.      when i see these anti-suicide things, i just feel so irked.  the only time you give a fuck about me is when i'm in a suicidal mindset.  beside that, i'm just a blank face.  a mere statistic.      believe me.  seriously.  believe me.  i'm not yanking your chain.  i know how bad suicide is.  you don't need to remind me of that.      i can't stop you from trying to prevent suicide, but i can state my opinion and so, i have.

1	but womyn don't exist, women do.
1	so the other day i was taking out the trash, and i dropped the bag just outside of the parking garage. it was a shitty cigarette-paper-thin plastic bag, so it ruptured and plenty of garbage leaked out.      i was pissed, and considered for a second to go back upstairs and get a broom. but then a panorama rolled in front of my eyes:      - 8 am drilling      - 6 am fireworks      - nongs blocking the staircase with old rusty bicycles      - cars going 60 km/h in the xiao qu      - dog shit      - the bunch of yappy little dogs imprisoned in one of the garages, constantly barking      so i left the bag exactly where it laid, i only pulled out a paper towel and took the empty package of food flavoring rainy used the night before that was very visible and would incriminate me if she saw it.      a few hours later she bitched about the low-life who dropped his garbage outside the parking garage and i whistled innocently.      chinar truly is turning me into a psychopath.

0	i've heard people (even on this sub) say they got bullied for it, which is not necessarily specific to asexuals (people can be bullied for just about anything), but i thought it worth mentioning.      beyond that, the two biggest problems asexuals seem to face are 1) not knowing it's possible to be asexual and thinking there is something wrong with them if they don't want sex, and 2) loneliness in adulthood. this applies to aromantics as well. both groups blame society for the second one because of how romantic relationships are normalized to the exclusion of other relationship types (i'm told keeping friends can be difficult when everyone else in your group is married), and romantic relationships after one's teenage years are expected to involve sex.      true, the oppression aces face doesn't remotely compare to a gay or bi person being killed for their sexuality, but it also isn't nothing.      this is not to be confused with the ***totally valid oppressions*** (read that with a heavy dose of sarcasm) of being kicked out of the lgbt community... *for not being oppressed enough*, and not seeing enough people like themselves in fiction and the media. those are mere symptoms of the deeper problem, and yet they are the things tumblr and twitter aces seem to get the most pissy about.

0	interesting thanks.      but what about zionism? why is it utterly absent from the great awakening? after all, zionists have had a disproportionate influence on the 20th century... most of what we think we know about ww1 and ww2 is wrong. the big lie of the 20th comes immediately to mind.      how will you produce an awakening without realizing whose boot has been on your neck? how can you speak of the vatican, without mentioning those that subverted it last?      this is my main concern with q material. it seems oblivious to something that is right there, in plain sight. or did i miss it? tell me what you think.
0	same story here. i put my bed legs into these anti-bedbug bowl things, dusted them and all around my bed anywhere i could with cimexa, dead fuckers turned up everywhere, never bothered me again after about a month. still for about a year after i'd wake up in the middle of the night looking for them. thankfully that seems to have stopped now as well

0	pretty sure this old pasta from a guy who used to post about bigfoot
0	the whole thing was so silly. as an april fool's joke, sure. go nuts. but to keep doing it for the purpose of raising awareness was a waste of time. they didn't reach anyone who didn't already agree with them, and they only confirmed the thoughts of those who disagree with them.      also, most people don't buy into the philosophy that racism requires social power dynamics to be defined.
0	porn is a separate realm of its own and often uses things that might be seen harmful for the enjoyment of both the viewer and the performer, so i'm not going to dig into that. but in media, even if the character is male identifying, the term trap still suggests malevolence. in addition, the difference from trans women isn't always clear, so the audience could connect the term to them even if that's not the purpose. terms like crossdresser or even transvestite seem much better to me.
0	i definitely think that animal therapy programs are a good way to bridge that gap.  back in my uni years, i did a term project on animal-assisted therapy (i considered it as a career) and was just amazed at the metrics when it came to turning around juvenile offenders by placing them in care positions (such as with horses or rehabbing abused dogs).  the work done with the elderly and infirm, especially with cats and their purrs having bone growth properties are just amazing.      but again, a hospital, a nursing home is a place you can't even wear perfume.  you could, possibly, *kill* someone by bringing an animal inside an environment like that.  it's the kind of thing that has to be case-by-case and can't negatively impact innocent bystanders.

0	really, "believe all victims" needs to come with an asterisk after "believe". i agree that you shouldn't respond to accusations with a knee-jerk "you're a liar", you should offer sympathy and should lean towards believing them, since the vast majority of accusations (98% of all crimes and 91% of sexual crimes, according to the fbi iirc) are true. what you should also do is weigh all the evidence as it is made known and if the evidence suggests that the crime was faked or the accusation is false to call that out as soon as is reasonable.      trust, but verify.
0	i dunno -- if i could be a man for a month, i can think of a number of worthwhile things i could do (explore my city's nightlife, travel alone and feel safe, talk to people and actually be taken seriously). but for a day, i'd probably just play helicopter with my dick and spell my name in the snow, not gonna lie.

0	yes you're kinda dumb. jesus how much evil does someone need to do to you before you take a stand. she betrayed your trust, broke her vows, tells you about this years after the kids are born so she's been able to milk you for support. now in a divorce you have child support and been together long enough for alimony. cheating isn't a mistake, it's a long series of choices that do irreparable damage. she did not care about you at all then, and she continued the lie each day she didn't tell you, robbing you of the opportunity to leave before conceiving a child and finding another more suitable  partner.      now you're older, have a kid, and she tells you since leaving would suck just as much as staying a blowing this off as just some mistake she made years ago.
1	i've been pondering a theory that tptb will eventually get rid of the monetary system all together and transition us to a social credit/debt system and our wealth/luxury of our life will be dictated by our social score.  the ideas are all around us at the moment, over in china they are beta testing the physical system of tracking and scoring, you have 5g which will be the platform for it to run on globally,  and then you have the social debt ideas being pushed by climate change.  over in europe they are talking about how when you are born, you are born with eco debt already and will need to work that off.  i could see a system where the plebs are born with eco debt and need to work that off, while also complying to the social norms and conditions set forth by the social credit system.        just an idea i've been kicking around in my head recently.

0	yeah, because the public and possible criminals often get to see the entire breadth of the investigation against them before they're even charged.      how many leaks around the nunes memo?   how many around the mueller investigation?    the answer is you don't know what evidence mueller has.   so when you suggest that he doesn't have any proof, you're saying something you don't know for a fact to be true.      "i believe it is an established maxim in morals that he who makes an assertion without knowing whether it is true or false, is guilty of falsehood; and the accidental truth of the assertion, does not justify or excuse him."   abraham lincoln.      don't look now but republican "honest" abe lincoln just called you a fuckin liar.
1	all i'm getting is that the two organizations are christian orgs, and chick-fil-a is owned by christians. call me cynical, but i feel like the anti-lgbt aspects aren't the focus of the groups, or the donations.      also, going off that same logic, isn't islam an anti-lgbt organization? why is islam touted so much by leftists if they are also super pro-lgbt?

1	similar here, i was raised in a big family except i was the youngest.  nothing about it makes me want to have children.  i understand that some people had terrific family lives where their parents taught them all kinds of interpersonal skills and were nurturing, etc... but that was far from my experience and i don't have those things internalized to pass on.  i've gotten very good with my cat though, as a middle aged man and i'm nurturing to her, but she's far less demanding than a child or children and i can afford her much more easily.        i dated a lot previously and grew a lot as a person and had some peak experiences but had a lot of bad experiences with women who had hidden agendas, issues with dishonesty, cheating, gaslighting, etc... so i gave it up and now focus on my job, friends and hobbies and i'm more consistently  happy than i've ever been in my life overall.

0	i think the idea of duality explains the nature of freemasonry very well. we've all heard stories about freemasons being involved in a lot of conspiracies and the like so i studied a little and i've met quite a few low level masons myself. even thought they deny it, they have a tendency for the occult and of keeping secrets, but overall freemasonry teaches them a lot of good things. a popular myth is that lucifer is the god of freemasonry, which is true, their version of lucifer is that of a benevolent being who represents knowledge and truth and they believe a true mason must constantly seek knowledge for the sake of others. the same thing can't be said about the high ranking masons, who worship a lot of wicked deities.      a good example of those high ranking masons could be the british royal family, like prince william and queen elizabeth, because a lot of members of that family are 32-33 degree masons, the rothschilds themselves have married with the british royals and they have married with a lot of the european noble families over time, like the aldobrandini family, which is part of the italian/black nobility families. so their wealth has grown over time. the rothschilds were involved in grooming clinton for presidency months before she launched her candidacy. and they also bailed out trump when he almost broke his father's business so they've been involved with a lot of politicians and it's safe to say a lot of those nobles i mentioned before are involved in the whole mess too.      so you see, both the stories about freemasonry being a friendly fraternity with slight occult leanings and the ones of the masons being dark occultist being involved in conspiracies are true simultaneously. that's why i consider freemasonry to be a secret society despite the fact that a lot of masons like to sell themselves as being part of an "open society". keeping secrets is common for even the low level members and the high level members are involved in a lot of corrupt things.      what interesting facts do you know about freemasonry and other secret societies?

0	the one that gets me is "i don't hate them, i just make fun of otherkin!" and i'm thinking...if the person isn't doing harm to anyone else, why do you think "i'm not really bullying this one person by calling them a degenerate, i'm just making fun of a slightly different group of people" is the gotcha to shut everyone down?      if you think lgbtq people are closeted a lot, just wait until you see how many lgbtq furries are closeted, and i'm guessing you got your stats from that same poll that indicates that the rates of being closeted skyrocket even higher if you're both lgbtq and a furry.      people like sonic fox and the like being able to display themselves publicly because they can feel comfortable enough knowing their existence isn't a crime or having fur cons is a big deal because dipshits dumping on furries.      it's one of those things where even if a "furries aren't people" joke doesn't seem like a big deal, if you've interacted with enough people, odds are you've run into a furry sooner or later.

0	how the fuck is it queerbaiting?? even if the model is a member of the lgbtq community doesn't mean that they'd be into the person that they have to kiss for an ad or commercial.  the person was doing their job and acting.  if this person can't seperate real life from a picture in a magazine, they've got issues.

0	it's not ok to kill. and you're right abortion is killing. but you cherry picked and ignored my most powerful arguement.       the system is currently not capable to treat our populations mentally unwell adults. how could we possibly expect it to succeed in raising children during their most crucial stages of development?  how can you support said system?      furthermore over and over again we hear how our government is not not screening  the adopted parents well enough to insure the child isnt just being miked. that's if they don't just end up disappearing. how many mass child graves have been found beneath orphanages?   go visit r/morbidreality and tell me how many terrible articles you find on adopted children being abused by their foster parents. now ponder how many people never get caught. think about the kids whose misplaced anger caused them to lose all credibillity with the people responsible for helping them. cried wolf too many times now nobody cares.    we are cultivating an ass backwards society. how can we expect different if we force broken people to bring broken children into a broken world.   we all die. you are ignoring the big picture.there is an equation here being ignored by everyone. your government wouldn't have it any other way. divide and conquer strikes again.

0	per the hill reporting: "the state will reportedly tax individuals who do not pay for health insurance in order to pay for part of the proposal. the policy would revive an individual mandate penalty that initially came with the federal health care bill former president obama signed into law." so those californians without insurance will pay for illegal adults to receive health insurance.

0	> like i can agree that our society values the feelings of women more than of men      does it? the last few thousand years of history were written by men about the deeds of other men. *maybe* right now, in 2019, society and culture cares what women think and feel. but it's only been like that for...a few years? if at all? (i mean, it's debatable that society and culture cares more about women than it does men....). for literally thousands of years in the west, women were largely relegated to second-class status while we were told that what men did and thought was very, very important. men's bodies and feelings were valued a lot more than women's bodies and feelings. it's only been a very, very short window of time when women were even considered to be *equal* to men....and somehow men are interpreting that to mean that women are valued more than men?      i think the issue here is that a lot of men on reddit have a very peculiar and incomplete view of human history

1	people who grew up in predominantly black "ghettos" have a certain dialect and vocabulary. they suppress this when talking to people outside the "ghetto".  white people who grew up their shouldn't be admonished for talking like that especially when talking to other people who also grew up there.
0	how?      so far today we've got drama about a bunch of white af mods at bpt insisting people verify their race, a gaming community's mods being paid off by a gaming company and cross-spectrum idiocy from every mod who thinks they have a political barrow to push. i fail to see how this sort of crap has ever helped a community. if it keeps up, reddit exists only until a viable alternative springs up -- then it goes the way of napster.
1	biggest problem currently is that a huge fraction of the top social media sites are owned by forgieners who think that their money trumps our rights. that and the huge number of bots and paid accounts that actively seek to act like everything is ok and belittle/harrass anyone who disagrees.      fun fact, ~90% of reddit accounts are bots or multiple accounts. twitter was at 50% last i looked.

1	you summed up perfectly the reasons why i am staunchly pro-life.      your point about how someone who kills a pregnant woman gets heavier punishment than someone killing a non pregnant woman highlights the mental gymnastics involved on if an unborn child is a living being.      i find it reprehensible that women are so entitled to demand the right to have unprotected sex without having to think about any of the likely outcomes and that they just casually have an abortion down the line. any society that promotes killing living beings like this under the guise of women's rights is a sick society.      very few abortion cases involve rape or incest yet those are the rare scenarios that pro-abortion women always try to use to defend abortion.

1	no, there are plenty of lazy and dumb women.  when you get far away from the mean, you find more men.  this is because men have a larger standard deviation in the intelligence distribution.  further, men are more competitive than women.  among other things, this drives them to seek out the best positions, work more overtime, and delay having a family.  sure, a few women will have the intelligence and drive to be a doctor, but at a lower rate than men.

0	my best guess is that either he has a hard time finding a girlfriend and/or is always single, so hanging out with his friends is like the only socializing he gets. it's understandable, but obviously he should be happy for his friend that he has a girlfriend, not upset at him for supposedly "neglecting" him. that's why "bros before hoes" is such bullshit. i'd never get mad at a female friend for not hanging out with me as much because they're busy having a boyfriend, husband, or family. i'd be happy for them and understand.      for whatever reason it seems like men have a harder time coming to terms with their feelings towards their male friends because "no homo" so they just freak out and lash out at them instead of just like, communicating to them about it calmly.

0	i ride a bike.  i always wear a helmet though my state does not require it.      the reality is that a helmet will protect from low-level injuries.       people who advocate for choice about helmet laws may just be resigned to the idea that wrecking on a bike will probably kill you anyway.      that's sad, but i can see how my dad for instance has seen enough death to know that most of those wouldn't be prevented by helmets.  a sorta bleak resignation that most fatal accidents won't be helped by helmets.      i feel like "let's not add to those numbers by going helmetless and dying in less extreme cases".
0	i've got some questions for you.      - **how old is your child?**      - **is your child the 1 most important thing in the world to you?**      - **do you still love this woman?** (i'd be surprised if you didn't).      these are the important things you need to answer to understand and make a proper decision on what to do from here on. being cheated on is a dreadful thing to experience but since there's a child involved here, hasty moves or bad decisions will affect the child more than it will affect you or her.      you don't have to give me the answers but at the very least, answer them for yourself and remember that your child is the most important thing to think about right now.       if your child is under 18, a divorce won't wreck the child's life but it'll turn their world upside down quite a bit. likewise, if you stay together, i can see the resentment building up and cause marital issues at home and if the child is present while they take place, it'll affect them badly as well.      you have financial problems as well that could come out of a divorce. you'll have to pay child support (likely). alimony is another problem you'll (probably) encounter. you'll have less say in your child's life if your child chooses to live with the mother. you won't get to see the child as much as much.       if you still love her then this makes this whole thing ten times harder than it already is. you can't help it but it's really not going to help you either. she might cheat on you again, she may even be cheating on you right now with a new person and you wouldn't even know it.      if you still have concerns about her cheating on you again, what would be the best course of action is to "separate" but only in your relationship and not your marriage. this is so the child gets the best benefit out of this. you're both still married, you live in the same house, you both take care of the kid but you're no longer "together".      that way, if she decides to cheat on you again, it won't cause any issues. you'll also be free to seek other women as well for your own benefit as well. and once the child reaches the age of 18 (or until the child moves out), you can decide to divorce her and forget about her.      but if you feel you can actually work it out properly and still have a proper relationship then you should try to do just that. it's down to your judgement ultimately. just remember, there's absolutely no reason why she wouldn't cheat again. she managed to hide this one from you for four years and you couldn't do a thing about it. *she had to tell you* and it was only because she couldn't handle the guilt anymore and even then, it was because she felt sorry for herself and not you.      i have to tell you, i'd be paranoid all the time. every single time she went out and came home late, "*is she fucking another guy again?*" every time she's on the phone, "*is she texting another guy? what are they talking about?*" every time she acts weird, down or strange, "*is she feeling guilty because she fucked another guy again?*"      or she doesn't want sex with you, "*did she already have sex with another guy? has she been cheating again?*" this is but a taste of what it feels like being with a person that has admitted to cheating on you. it's mental torture of insecurity, paranoia and heartbreak and you'll hate every second of it.      jesus, it'd be pretty bad, so do it how you want to do it but make sure the child doesn't get punished for it. look after your own mental health as well and don't brutalize or mentally torture your wife either.      if you're feeling angry or sad, don't make any decisions until the feeling passes.       i wish you good luck, bud.

0	weird that you say that because folks have been marching and holding signs about police violence for years but nobody really started caring until one guy decided to kneel during a song.      kneeling during the anthem also doesn't inconvenience anyone, except maybe the nfl and it's advertisers, unlike an organized protest which often shuts down streets and hurt local businesses.      it seems to me the only people kneeling during the anthem hurts is snowflakes that meltdown every time they're confronted with a contradictory opinion.

0	to be fair, socialists are probably the worst people to ask about socialism, as cultists tend to have compromised opinions about their cults.       seriously, i've been reading engels lately, and the guy's a fucking hack. i swear you could go through his work and find-and-replace-text, and change every instance of "necessarily" to "mystically", and every example of "necessary" to "eldritch", and it would read exactly the same way. anyone who'd read his drivel and view it as innovation to be implemented, that's some jonestown-tier decision making...jonestown itself having been a socialist commune, i suddenly recall.

(i mean, it's debatable that society and culture cares more about women than it does men....). for literally thousands of years in the west, women were largely relegated to second-class status while we were told that what men did and thought was very, very important. men's bodies and feelings were valued a lot more than women's bodies and feelings. it's only been a very, very short window of time when women were even considered to be *equal* to men....and somehow men are interpreting that to mean that women are valued more than men?      i think the issue here is that a lot of men on reddit have a very peculiar and incomplete view of human history

0	first of all, i don't know if the girl even wants me as a friend. sometimes she takes one, two days to answer my messages. but she always answers, so i guess she is at least a tiny bit interested in talking to me. otherwise she'd already have ghosted me. however, i do recognise that i might have driven her away a bit by avoiding to see her back then.      i went to a therapist back when i was 17 to talk about this and some other, darker, things. she ended up saying that she didn't treat troubles as bad as mine, gave me another place's number & charged me anyway. i'll never go to a therapist again, since she was not the first one i went to during my life. i went to one when i was 5, another one when i was 12 and another one when i was 14. neither one of them were able to help me at all with the issue i faced at the time (i don't quite remember why i went when i was 5 but the other two times were because of anger management issues).       last year i thought of fixing my anxiety myself with meds since it got really bad (i got to the point of stuttering once when talking to two girls and one guy), but i couldn't find any pharmacy willing to sell them to me without a prescription so i couldn't do anything about it.      i don't know if i like anything about myself. i'm a good friend, i guess? back when i had friends i always stood by their side and always listened to them when they had some sort of problem. but i don't know... i was always the one initiating conversations & when i decided to let them start one i never heard from them again.      and about my life... i don't know. the only things i can come up with are material things such as not having to work like most people my age and having two cars for myself (whereas most people my age have to use public transport) but i guess these don't count. i don't have much going on.

0	pro lgbt jesuit priest james martin      since 2011 the chaplain of the united states house of representatives has been lgbt advocate jesuit priest patrick conroy. republicans, who held a majority of seats in 2011, and democrats, who now hold the majority of seats, voted him in. pro lgbt jesuit priest james martin has received awards from groups propagating the gay agenda. jesuit priests promote the normalization of the lgbt by referring to parts of the bible that deals with accepting all people. but to claim that god made a mistake in creating you, and 'you' know better is adversarial and contrary to the scriptures. a catholic priest in denver expressed this notion after regis university, a jesuit-catholic university, encouraged it's faculty to attend a student-ran drag show commemorating "transgender day of remembrance". the jesuits have a hand in promoting lgbt which will help lead into transhumanism.

0	my dad was a cop as was my uncle, grandfather, and my cousin is currently a cop. they work/ed for what i consider to be good departments that are widely respected by their communities.       i always grew up thinking cops were great and i didnt  understand cop hate... and then i went to nyc for a few months. nyc is a first world city with 3rd world police.       to say it was eye opening is an understatement. i had a cop kick my door open because i was too slow to open it during a noise complaint on my neighbor.
0	honestly, they are decent sometimes but the over production and the amazingly cheesy little "quotes" they have run across the screen during interviews is painful at best to watch. i can see the appeal of the channel but the whole ordeal seems to be cheesy and way too deep in the conspiracy kool aid.
0	nah half of them are just critiques of leftist ideology. i don't know why you define a whole sub as incels and bigots because you saw a few that you didn't like and a few alt-righters there.       having been part of that sub for a few days and engaged with them, i can tell you most are just regular conservatives.       unless of course you meant to say "anyone who is remotely right is guilty of [insert ad hominem here]" which is the type of mentality most of the memes poked fun of.      a minority of racist, sexist etc memes are no reason to quarantine a sub.

1	this subreddit isn't for making fun of liberal opinions that you happen to disagree with.  it's for making fun of ridiculous otherkin/transtrender/kill all men people.      ambulances are in fact expensive in america, and they are in fact free in many other first world countries (and even developing countries).  whether or not you agree that ambulances *should* be free, it is understandable that someone who grew up somewhere with free ambulances would be shocked at the cost of ambulances in america.  that is a completely reasonable reaction.      which is why this post does not belong here.

0	what does that have to do with atheism? you'd think a sub called [USER] would just focus on religion.
0	this. earlier one was christian themed.
0	i think i understand what theyre saying. but it shows just how hateful and ignorant they are.      what they mean by "everyone is sad and lonely and this company has been telling them what they want to hear for the last 20 years" is that the games, and franchise as a whole, teach that friendship and companionship are important and help you achieve great things that wouldve been impossible for you to do on your own.      in red ans blue, we're told the reason we keep beating blue is because we treat our pokemon as our friends, while hes only concerned with having the strongest team. he looses because his pokemon dont actually care aboit him because he doesnt show them kindness, while our pokemon go above and beyond because they genuinely dont want to let us down - this is a theme continued in nearly every game in the franchise.         now, heres the sad part. they say this is "the same way the alt right recruits incels" which is partially true.   kind of. theres a grain of truth in it in that its easy to radicalize groups that have been oppressed, mistreated, etc. this is the same basic recruiting tactic that isis uses; they find vulnerable people and promise them that they can be apart of something bigger, something greater, somewhere that they can finally belong. - cults have also been known to use this tactic.      but, instead of looking at that and going "maybe we should treat people better, show them basic human kindness and respect. let them know theyre valued as a person even if they disagree with me" they miss the point and go "pikachu must be a nhazi!!! thats the only possible conclusion!!!"

0	i think its a fascinating phenomenon, the disconnect between what many women are convinced they should want in a man (in this case, an emasculated nice guy), vs what they actually do want. also, how i can believe that i should only want to eat vegetables and lean proteins, but that doesn't change my body's cravings for sugary foods. i just think that its funny how people can form ideologies against their own natures.
0	i'm sorry to hear that
0	places like r/askscience and r/askhistory * remove comments that aren't serious answers, are jokes, or don't have any evidence backing them up. in all reality this was probably just a joke that somebody wrote and it probably didn't answer the question. which is something the moderators would (understandably) remove. not really cancer.

0	hey sorry guys apparently i have a victim complex because i'm white and identify as the gender i was born, not because i was...a victim...or something...
0	thank you.  the funny thing about the whole incident was that a lot of older posters and the mods liked, and did not disagree, with my post.  but, they claimed that there were many who didn't and after months of being told i was an awesome mod, they were suddenly changing the rules and trying to make drama out of a post where i essentially said, "act like an adult and understand that people disagree now and then."  ironic, no?   as far as everything else goes, i was offered the chance to stay on as a mod...but, with no posting power.  i chose to leave because it made no sense that a post that didn't break the tos and was well received by the majority of the community would earn a punishment. when certain forum members started sharing details that should've remained within the four mods...i bounced because it was clear that information was being shared with non-mods, but friends of mods.   in fact, i was happy to stay quiet and allow bygones to be bygones until i noted that the person who created the most drama was running her mouth in other places trying to bad mouth me.  whatever ,it's reddit, but there's not enough time in the day to dedicate yourself to silencing someone because you want to be snarkier than everyone else.  i wish that forum nothing but good things and i'm disappointed it went down the way it did.
0	oh to be 11
0	this exactly. not to mention the fact that black women are already among the most socioeoconomically fucked groups from generations of not having enough fucking resources, which gets way worse for anyone when they have a child to take care of. this is almost surreally racist.
0	oh man [USER].      i dared to ask if the sub could get a few more mods added, as the 2 that are there are a *teeny weeny* bit over zealous with banning people and removing posts.  for that, i got shadowbanned, then banned, then received taunts from the mod for about a week afterwards.      [URL]
0	of course it won't. same thing with the reddit premium ad. they want as many people on board the redesign as possible before they permanently transition.      reddit is about to become digg 2.0
0	you wasn't even raped as a "guy", but as a "kid" and you're far more likely to get raped as a minor of any gender, than as a grown ass woman.             don't get me wrong every single instance of abuse is important, to notice, counteract and hopefully prevent in the future. our view on it just shows how long the way we still have to go is.

1	it's a very different scene in the kink spaces - probably because those people actually would like to live it in the real world, and there you simply cannot get away from the fact that everyone is an adult.      it's still super weird, but without this aggressively pedo creepy vibe.

0	the problem is that the ev for theft in california is now positive.  a decent shoplifter can expect to be caught one time in one hundred or less.  if you can steal 100 items woth $50 and face only a small fine the one time you get caught then stealing becomes a very profitable business.      all theft should be criminal.  people who are caught committing multiple thefts have shown that they're unable to be productive members of society and should be punished much, much more severely.  i would suggest that the first time a person is caught stealing they should be given a fine ~ doublethevalue of what they stole, and a warningnot to repeat their actions.  the second time they get caught they have proven themselves unable to behave within society, and they should automatically receive a long sentence of hard labor.
0	a thank you or just a general follow-up, yeah.
1	>why the fuck would they do that... dude not all guys jerk eachother off. you fucking faggot. i think they're boyfriends at that point buddy. don't worry, it's pride month. we're fine with you come out of the closet. fucking thinking that's all dude do if they aren't hanging out with chicks.... how fucking gay do you gotta be.       yo what the fuck? it was in response to someone saying that the bro code is basically just a bunch of dudes jacking each other off.

0	this thread i am linking is full of idiots. so many redditors who think they can cleverly veil their racism by latching on to a black guy with an opinion similar to theirs on a surface level are just foolish. i am getting really tired of this if it aint white its pc gone mad or some flavor of that.

0	they have very strict comment rules. no jokes, tight limits on anecdote etc.      for the most part, they enforce the rules fairly (just based on my own personal experience).      if you want a community with less restrictions on posting/commenting check out r/sciences. i think it is a pretty cool place. but i might be biased since i started the subreddit

0	i've had numerous posts removed from r/politics now, usually ones simply espousing left wing (by which i mean actually-left-wing, not "vote blue no matter who" liberalism) and/or anti imperialist viewpoints. most in that sub have been reinstated, but the mods refuse to tell me why my comments were deleted. allegedly it was "false positives" picked up by their bot, and telling me why my comments got picked up will "let bad actors defeat the bot."      this isn't just limited to r/politics, though. i've had dozens of comments removed now from various subreddits. the most recent was a response to the question "what's wrong with being a landlord," which broke no rules and yet was shadow deleted a few hours later (implying to me that it was a manual deletion, not a bot).       i think this is all so fucked up. if you disagree with me, downvote me, argue with me, don't arbitrarily remove my responses.      if my comment breaks rules, delete it and inform me of the rule violation, don't just insidiously delete it for everyone *but* me without me even being aware of the fact or the reason why.       i'm getting increasingly angry over all of this. there's literally no recourse except to pm the mods and hope for an answer, but if they don't want to reinstate your comment then fuck you. it's absurd.       just wanted to let everyone know that this is sop on reddit right now, so if you've ever chimed in on a discussion only to have 0 upvotes, downvotes, or comments- check to see if you've been shadow censored.

0	the one that gets me is "i don't hate them, i just make fun of otherkin!" and i'm thinking...if the person isn't doing harm to anyone else, why do you think "i'm not really bullying this one person by calling them a degenerate, i'm just making fun of a slightly different group of people" is the gotcha to shut everyone down?      if you think lgbtq people are closeted a lot, just wait until you see how many lgbtq furries are closeted, and i'm guessing you got your stats from that same poll that indicates that the rates of being closeted skyrocket even higher if you're both lgbtq and a furry.      people like sonic fox and the like being able to display themselves publicly because they can feel comfortable enough knowing their existence isn't a crime or having fur cons is a big deal because dipshits dumping on furries.      it's one of those things where even if a "furries aren't people" joke doesn't seem like a big deal, if you've interacted with enough people, odds are you've run into a furry sooner or later.

1	no, not until you learn some manners.  offence is not given it is taken, and your refusal to take responsibility for understanding the effect of your words on your victims, or that your victims *are* victims, is part of the problem.        the hyperpolarisation the us is leading the world into has turned white and male fragilities into weapons, to be polished and oiled and caressed lovingly.   there is an ecosystem of businesses built on exploiting white and male fragilities, pandering and nourishing them.   there is huge grassroots support, countless volunteers doing the thankless work of rage-reading liberal sites and responding.     *somebody* has to not-buy all those gillette razor blades, and these are the people who do it.        it is going to get a lot worse imo.  can israel vs palestine be implemented inside the us?  why not?        liberals' smug myopia is one of the reasons trumpism has arisen and continues to conquer the us, sweeping all before it.   i'm picking a second term of trump, with a handover to pence so he can abuse the presidential pardon to get / keep the crew out of jail.     but pardoning requires charging, and i think trump knows where to find dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to pence.        tl;dr     you know that sjw cartoon of "i'm not racist but ..." where the friend covers their mouth with a mittened hand, and says "shush, nothing good ever comes after that"?      whenever you catch yourself wanting to write "white people" or "white males", just shush yourself.  never mind your theories about what you think you are trying to say.  your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the us are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.  you can call them stupid neanderthals but they out-manoevered your side and have stacked the federal courts and  supreme court for a few decades.  if trump were impeached tomorrow they still would be winning. for decades.

0	most people want to feel useful in life, i think. what i'm trying to let you know is that at 19 you have a lot of life left to be useful.       i really do understand how hard it can be to feel alone. i was homeless when i was 20 and felt much the same as you describe above. i got a job at 21 that enabled me to get a place to live, from there i continued to just try to find some way to be useful and find people that i could 'belong' with. it didn't always work, and it was certainly difficult at times, but there were also lots of little triumphs that helped spur me along.      don't give up just yet. you really don't know who you're going to be there for later on. that person might make it all worthwhile. it just might take time.

0	i am 38.  i've suffered from depression since i was a young kid.  it is tough for me to find happiness, and especially hard to get motivated most of the time.  i have been through some very, very, tough times in my life, and that doesn't help.  i was on meds from around 18 years old until 4 years ago.  i cut that ball and chain by eating a very clean diet, exercise, meditation, and self help therapy.        my best advice to you is to find something(s) that makes you happy (i know its tough).  for me, music, my guitar, my pets, and reading are what bring joy to me.  maybe try to pick up a new hobby?      hang in there.  you are not alone.  i have learned the hard way that i (you) am the only one that can bring happiness and meaning into my life.        always here to lend an ear if you need to talk.        namaste

0	yeah. and the hilarious part is a lot of the times, these sjws aren't the race of the people they're trying to defend. like there was this one case of some creeps taking a picture from facebook of a little girl in a kimono, having a tea ceremony for her birthday party because according to her parents, she was into japan. people were shrieking about how this little kid who was maybe eight at most and her parents were racist. and then this japanese person from japan replied and pointed out that japanese people loved people of other ethnicities wearing kimonos and that they were even sold and gifted. even pointed out how respectful the little girl was being.      and i know if my friend since middle school who is chinese knew of people trying to act like white people eating chinese food was a bad thing, she'd be very confused and annoyed.

0	this is mostly just for my peace of mind but here goes.      a few years ago i met a girl, we'll call her margo, who was amazing in a million ways.  she was musical, beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent, and she was not my wife.        while my marriage was on the rocks at the time, and my wife wasn't around very much, we were still married.  it was a very dark time for me, but margo was like a massive light that enveloped me and reminded me of who i was.      i think it's worth mentioning that margo and i never slept together, however we absolutely developed real, and deep feelings for each other.      anyway, eventually my wife finds out i've been connecting with margo, and is (rightfully) furious.  there were a few tear filled nights, and some very hard conversations, but in the end, we decided to work things out.  i unceremoniously, (and with much difficulty and hesitation) ended contact with margo.  i still feel horrible about how this all happened because she really was an amazing person who didn't deserve any of the drama i brought upon her.      so, my wife and i work things out, and things are better than they've ever been between us.  we re-found the love we had somehow lost, and are stronger because of everything that happened.  that being said, there was still always a part of me that was just.... empty and regretful.  not because of how things turned out but because of the way they happened.  i was also worried about margo, because for a long time i was her sounding board, and now, i couldn't help her.      tonight i randomly decided to google margo, and there was a video of her singing a brand new song, and parts of it were too specific to not be about what happened between us, but it gave me closure that everything is alright now.      it's late and i'm tired but happy. even though this is a throwaway account i'm hoping this post just gets buried in the "new" pile. this was more for me than anything, because i don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff, and posting it here feels like talking about it.  if you read this far, congratulations determined reader.      tl;dr   not really interesting.

0	yep.  can't talk about it. can't speculate.  only the official narrative (which often changes) is allowed.      it's how they went after alex jones and it was their excuse for de-platforming him.        i was listening to his show all week when sandy hook happened.  he did a lot of speculating.  at first he said it he thought it was fake or staged.  as more info came to light he backpeddled.  by the 2nd week he said he didn't think it was fake any more.  he then started going with the official account given by authorities.  then he dropped it altogether when the change of heart caused a divide in his viewers.          of course the media doesn't explain any of that.  only cares that he dared to question the official narrative (briefly).

0	they used to. religious people figured it was sinful if you tugged or poked more than twice in the shower.      personally, i think it'd be a good idea for girls to get familiar with themselves more. a lot of women report not even having their first actual orgasms until their 20s, masturbation would help with that.

0	i have a dark sense of humour. i never really make jokes about gays, though.       i mean, i'm sure i've made a joke aimed at a gay man before, but the focus of the humour wasn't in any way related to his sexuality.      my jokes mostly rely on dead baby humour, being a serial killer, or cannibalism (though i hate that word. i prefer to think of myself as a humanitarian). it's not about killing gays, or hating *anyone,* it's about being hungry.      the only group i specifically target is vegetarians and vegans, because they eat what food eats, therefore by the transitive property, they are food. that's not hate, that's just math.

0	most people want to feel useful in life, i think. what i'm trying to let you know is that at 19 you have a lot of life left to be useful.       i really do understand how hard it can be to feel alone. i was homeless when i was 20 and felt much the same as you describe above. i got a job at 21 that enabled me to get a place to live, from there i continued to just try to find some way to be useful and find people that i could 'belong' with. it didn't always work, and it was certainly difficult at times, but there were also lots of little triumphs that helped spur me along.      don't give up just yet. you really don't know who you're going to be there for later on. that person might make it all worthwhile. it just might take time.

1	no, it is factually true. if you don't have dysphoria, that means you're comfortable with your genitals, meaning you aren't trans.      > in reference to genders? unknown. as gender is a psychological way of thinking there is theoretically countless genders.      gender is "how comfortable you are with your genitals". if you have a penis and are ok with it, you're a man, if not, you're a transwoman, and the same for vaginas.      don't confuse "gender roles" with "gender". being a man doesn't preclude you from wearing dresses and being a woman doesn't preclude you from working as a trucker.      > in reference to biological sex? a confirmed minimum of 4. as sex is a physical characteristic, at the moment we can confirm 4 different sex characteristics (penis, vagina, both p & v or neither) but this could change in the future.      there's no biological basis for this. anomalies are exactly that, anomalies, they do not form part of the characteristics of the species, and humans are a sexual species, meaning two sexes.      > with all of this gender/sex/sexuality discussions we need to remember that it's a change field of research and if my years of sexology education and research has told me anything, it's that everything we know is changing and we're finding out more and more about human sexuality every single day.      humans aren't special, we're exactly like almost every other mammal as far as sex comes.

0	for the record, not all atheists are douchebags. seems like you found one. he may well have plenty to sort, but facts are what's left at the end of the day.      also, i understand that because of your upbringing having someone "take your virginity" can be a big deal, but know that just because you had sex with someone it doesn't make you less worthy. the emotional turmoil is strong, i'm well aware, but not being a virgin anymore doesn't make you a slut or whatever.      to me the emotional side of the story far, far outweighs the physiological slight change. a hymen maketh not the good woman.      rape victims aren't debauched people. you've been abused, deceived, to me you're in a situation closer to having been raped than just dumped. do not let this experience define you.      i suggest you read about the psychology of the raped person, you *weren't* raped but i think you may find info not completely irrelevant to what you're going through atm.       you take care girl, you'll be fine. keep on going in your philosophical path, to me it's fine if you remain a believer as long as that doesn't make you hurt others or yourself. but don't go around thinking you owe your family or a future bf / husband to remain a christian, a virgin etc. you do you.       peace prevails.

0	thank you.  the funny thing about the whole incident was that a lot of older posters and the mods liked, and did not disagree, with my post.  but, they claimed that there were many who didn't and after months of being told i was an awesome mod, they were suddenly changing the rules and trying to make drama out of a post where i essentially said, "act like an adult and understand that people disagree now and then."  ironic, no?   as far as everything else goes, i was offered the chance to stay on as a mod...but, with no posting power.  i chose to leave because it made no sense that a post that didn't break the tos and was well received by the majority of the community would earn a punishment. when certain forum members started sharing details that should've remained within the four mods...i bounced because it was clear that information was being shared with non-mods, but friends of mods.   in fact, i was happy to stay quiet and allow bygones to be bygones until i noted that the person who created the most drama was running her mouth in other places trying to bad mouth me.  whatever ,it's reddit, but there's not enough time in the day to dedicate yourself to silencing someone because you want to be snarkier than everyone else.  i wish that forum nothing but good things and i'm disappointed it went down the way it did.
1	no, not until you learn some manners.  offence is not given it is taken, and your refusal to take responsibility for understanding the effect of your words on your victims, or that your victims *are* victims, is part of the problem.        the hyperpolarisation the us is leading the world into has turned white and male fragilities into weapons, to be polished and oiled and caressed lovingly.   there is an ecosystem of businesses built on exploiting white and male fragilities, pandering and nourishing them.   there is huge grassroots support, countless volunteers doing the thankless work of rage-reading liberal sites and responding.     *somebody* has to not-buy all those gillette razor blades, and these are the people who do it.        it is going to get a lot worse imo.  can israel vs palestine be implemented inside the us?  why not?        liberals' smug myopia is one of the reasons trumpism has arisen and continues to conquer the us, sweeping all before it.   i'm picking a second term of trump, with a handover to pence so he can abuse the presidential pardon to get / keep the crew out of jail.     but pardoning requires charging, and i think trump knows where to find dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to pence.        tl;dr     you know that sjw cartoon of "i'm not racist but ..." where the friend covers their mouth with a mittened hand, and says "shush, nothing good ever comes after that"?      whenever you catch yourself wanting to write "white people" or "white males", just shush yourself.  never mind your theories about what you think you are trying to say.  your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the us are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.  you can call them stupid neanderthals but they out-manoevered your side and have stacked the federal courts and  supreme court for a few decades.  if trump were impeached tomorrow they still would be winning. for decades.

0	the massacre at columbine high school took place on april 20, 1999. astonishingly, for eight days after the tragedy, during thousands of hours of prime-time television coverage, virtually no one mentioned the word "drugs." then the issue was opened. eric harris, one of the shooters at columbine, was on at least one drug.      the ny times of april 29, 1999, and other papers reported that harris was rejected from enlisting in the marines for medical reasons. a friend of the family told the times that harris was being treated by a psychiatrist. and then several sources told the washington post that the drug prescribed as treatment was luvox, manufactured by solvay.      in two more days, the "drug-issue" was gone.      luvox is of the same class as prozac and zoloft and paxil. they are labeled ssris (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). they attempt to alleviate depression by changing brain-levels of the natural substance serotonin. luvox has a slightly different chemical configuration from prozac, paxil, and zoloft, and it was approved by the fda for obsessive-compulsive disorder, although many doctors apparently prescribe it for depression.      prozac is the wildly popular eli lilly antidepressant which has been linked to suicidal and homicidal actions. it is now given to young children. again, its chemical composition is very close to luvox, the drug that harris took.      dr. peter breggin, the eminent psychiatrist and author (toxic psychiatry, talking back to prozac, talking back to ritalin), told me, "with luvox there is some evidence of a four-percent rate for mania in adolescents. mania, for certain individuals, could be a component in grandiose plans to destroy large numbers of other people. mania can go over the hill to psychosis."      dr. joseph tarantolo is a psychiatrist in private practice in washington dc. he is the president of the washington chapter of the american society of psychoanalytic physicians. tarantolo states that "all the ssris [including prozac and luvox] relieve the patient of feeling. he becomes less empathic, as in `i don't care as much,' which means `it's easier for me to harm you.' if a doctor treats someone who needs a great deal of strength just to think straight, and gives him one of these drugs, that could push him over the edge into violent behavior."      in arianna huffington's syndicated newspaper column of july 9, 1998, dr. breggin states, "i have no doubt that prozac can cause or contribute to violence and suicide. i've seen many cases. in a recent clinical trial, 6 percent of the children became psychotic on prozac. and manic psychosis can lead to violence."      a study from the september 1989 journal of clinical psychiatry, by joseph lipiniski, jr., indicates that in five examined cases people on prozac developed what is called akathesia. symptoms include intense anxiety, inability to sleep, the "jerking of extremities," and "bicycling in bed or just turning around and around." dr. breggin comments that akathesia "may also contribute to the drug's tendency to cause self-destructive or violent tendencies ... akathesia can become the equivalent of biochemical torture and could possibly tip someone over the edge into self-destructive or violent behavior ... the june 1990 health newsletter, produced by the public citizen research group, reports, 'akathesia, or symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, and purposeless movements of the feet and legs, may occur in 10-25 percent of patients on prozac.'"      other studies:      "emergence of self-destructive phenomena in children and adolescents during fluoxetine [prozac] treatment," published in the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry (1991, vol.30), written by ra king, ra riddle, et al. it reports self-destructive phenomena in 14% (6/42) of children and adolescents (10-17 years old) who had treatment with fluoxetine (prozac) for obsessive-compulsive disorder.      july, 1991. journal of child and adolescent psychiatry. hisako koizumi, md, describes a thirteen-year-old boy who was on prozac: "full of energy," "hyperactive," "clown-like." all this devolved into sudden violent actions which were "totally unlike him."      september, 1991. the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry. author laurence jerome reports the case of a ten-year old who moves with his family to a new location. becoming depressed, the boy is put on prozac by a doctor. the boy is then "hyperactive, agitated ... irritable." he makes a "somewhat grandiose assessment of his own abilities." then he calls a stranger on the phone and says he is going to kill him. the prozac is stopped, and the symptoms disappear.      the well-known goodman and gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics reveals a strange fact. it states that ritalin [given for adhd] is "structurally related to amphetamines ... its pharmacological properties are essentially the same as those of the amphetamines." in other words, the only clear difference is legality. and the effects, in layman's terms, are obvious. you take speed and, sooner or later, you start crashing. you become agitated, irritable, paranoid, delusional, aggressive.      in his book, toxic psychiatry, dr. breggin discusses the subject of drug combinations: "combining antidepressants [e.g., prozac, luvox, paxil] and psychostimulants [e.g., ritalin] increases the risk of cardiovascular catastrophe, seizures, sedation, euphoria, and psychosis. withdrawal from the combination can cause a severe reaction that includes confusion, emotional instability, agitation, and aggression." children are frequently medicated with this combination, and when we highlight such effects as aggression, psychosis, and emotional instability, it is obvious that the result is pointing toward the very real possibility of violence.      in 1986, the international journal of the addictions published a most important literature review by richard scarnati. it was titled, "an outline of hazardous side effects of ritalin (methylphenidate)" [v.21(7), pp. 837-841].      scarnati listed over a hundred adverse affects of ritalin and indexed published journal articles for each of these symptoms.

0	>one that doesn't apply to other relationships in problematic ways      well there's the power dynamic argument. there are incestuous relationships without obvious power imbalances, but i would argue that all of them have some degree of it, though some is stemming from the fact that it's a societal taboo.      >risk of birth defects      i think this is a bit of a simplification. inbreeding is more harmful as a practice than the individual instances. while contraception makes this less of a moral argument against individual instances, comparing it to people with dwarfism having sex is a bit misleading. though on a related note: this movie is hilariously bad.

0	so which rule did he violate internet people:      if you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action.      rule 0: be civil   let's keep the talk and discussion on what ever the subject matter of the post may be. resorting to personal quarrels and arguments that may use insults and other tribal-like behaviors will be deleted. keep it civil.      rule 1: correct formatting   the requirements for posting to this subreddit is to have a self contained opinion within the title. the text will be used to expand and elaborate on why you think/feel this way. you may also include why you think this is an unpopular or controversial opinion.      rule 2: opinion must be unpopular/controversial   this sub isn't just opinions, but unpopular and/or controversial ones. if your opinion has been posted to the subreddit recently, chances are it'll get removed. so please search before submitting.      rule 3: no reposts/search before submitting   if essentially the same opinion gets reposted it'll automatically mean it's not an unpopular opinion (within the context of the sub). it will get removed. if your opinion is about a ongoing event, there will usually be a mega thread where you can discuss there.      rule 4: no spam   new accounts are subject to a 24 hour waiting period before posting. spamming will usually result to a perma ban.      rule 5: no trolling   trolling is saying random unsolicited things that only serve to invoke a knee jerk reaction. trolls will usually get permanently banned.      rule 6: elaborate   an important rule in this subreddit is that all opinions must be elaborated on. there is a discussion to be had, so please expand on what you have said.   your post must contain more than 160 characters (roughly two or three standard sentences) to avoid auto-deletion by automod.      rule 7: hate posts are not allowed   opinion can be unpopular unless it's blatantly a hateful post. hostile, rude and aggressive behavior is not a necessity to express your opinion. please be civil and and have respect. bear in mind that justifying or endorsing pedophilia activities (sidenote: discussion on treatments of the mental health itself is fine), rape, race issues, assault or other similar crimes will usually count as hate speech. this does not mean you'll get banned for saying one crime is not as severe as another or saying you can understand why someone would commit a crime. race baiting is a ban-able offence      rule 8: no low effort/satire posts   any opinion that is not thought out well or posts that clearly have very little effort put into them will be removed. this also includes commonly posted opinions to the subreddit. please note that obscure topics and meta commentaries on the subreddit do not constitute a valid unpopular opinion post."

0	really, "believe all victims" needs to come with an asterisk after "believe". i agree that you shouldn't respond to accusations with a knee-jerk "you're a liar", you should offer sympathy and should lean towards believing them, since the vast majority of accusations (98% of all crimes and 91% of sexual crimes, according to the fbi iirc) are true. what you should also do is weigh all the evidence as it is made known and if the evidence suggests that the crime was faked or the accusation is false to call that out as soon as is reasonable.      trust, but verify.

0	it's not ok to kill. and you're right abortion is killing. but you cherry picked and ignored my most powerful arguement.       the system is currently not capable to treat our populations mentally unwell adults. how could we possibly expect it to succeed in raising children during their most crucial stages of development?  how can you support said system?      furthermore over and over again we hear how our government is not not screening  the adopted parents well enough to insure the child isnt just being miked. that's if they don't just end up disappearing. how many mass child graves have been found beneath orphanages?   go visit r/morbidreality and tell me how many terrible articles you find on adopted children being abused by their foster parents. now ponder how many people never get caught. think about the kids whose misplaced anger caused them to lose all credibillity with the people responsible for helping them. cried wolf too many times now nobody cares.    we are cultivating an ass backwards society. how can we expect different if we force broken people to bring broken children into a broken world.   we all die. you are ignoring the big picture.there is an equation here being ignored by everyone. your government wouldn't have it any other way. divide and conquer strikes again.

1	biggest problem currently is that a huge fraction of the top social media sites are owned by forgieners who think that their money trumps our rights. that and the huge number of bots and paid accounts that actively seek to act like everything is ok and belittle/harrass anyone who disagrees.      fun fact, ~90% of reddit accounts are bots or multiple accounts. twitter was at 50% last i looked.

1	the old white people running monopolies don't care for the minorities that work at their company, and would rather pay them shit all and keep them poor.
0	no, at the time.  he didn't come across with another date until he found someone he thought was interested in him.  she did wrong but he also did when he made arrangements with her knowing she was the backup in case he didn't find someone better.  they both wanted what they wanted and were unwilling to possibly do without in order to treat another person kindly.      he could have said that their arrangements to go together were contingent on whether he found a person that was dating material to go with him.  that's fine.   you have to think that some women are told guys are just going to use them for sex, so finding out a guy doesn't want to do something friendly together when he doesn't think he will score bugs some women.  like being friend zoned does for men.        they both did wrong, but i think she was the one with the most responsibility because she shouldn't have accepted the offer if she didn't want to date him.

0	i would say honest abe lincoln would have more problems with an open-ended investigation that was based on a false report (the steele dossier).  a defense of the republic requires us to be vigilant of any overreach of government power, and the power of a prosecutor with a blank check to investigate anything is among the most dangerous power there is.      then there's the fact that as you pointed out so many leaks during the mueller investigation.  does anyone seriously believe that if the investigation uncovered a "smoking gun" evidence that it won't be leaked and end up on the front page of the nyt the very next day?  the fact no such event happened strongly suggests that mueller tried for nearly 2 years but couldn't find any crime to tie to trump.

0	if she were all of those things except she had republican policies, then republicans would love her. it's actually that simple, because they just care about her ideas.      meanwhile, if she were a republican, the people on the left holding her up would probably refuse to call her 3 out of 5 of those things and claim she doesn't represent the last two all of a sudden.      evidence of their delusion when waaaay down at the bottom of the thread, someone points out that the right-wing likes candace owens so this theory makes no sense. someone responds with:      > tokenism?      so they hate aoc because she's 'poc', but they love candace owens because she's 'poc'.

0	> in fact let's ask the saudi education system, which condemns all other muslim groups.   >    > the official religious school [because islam is not a monolithic bloc] of the saudis is wahhabism, which didn't emerge until the 1700s, and while sadly strong, is not a majority school, even if you count its salafi and deobandi affiliates.      precisely, you nailed it. wahhabism isn't just strong, is the biggest influence because of the power of saudi arabia, a country that not only has an almost unlimited amount of resources but also uses them to spread as much propaganda as they want.      i'm all up for reforming islam, throwing all the backwards shit away and putting it under control like the west did with the church. but right now, that just isn't the case.

1	i've been pondering a theory that tptb will eventually get rid of the monetary system all together and transition us to a social credit/debt system and our wealth/luxury of our life will be dictated by our social score.  the ideas are all around us at the moment, over in china they are beta testing the physical system of tracking and scoring, you have 5g which will be the platform for it to run on globally,  and then you have the social debt ideas being pushed by climate change.  over in europe they are talking about how when you are born, you are born with eco debt already and will need to work that off.  i could see a system where the plebs are born with eco debt and need to work that off, while also complying to the social norms and conditions set forth by the social credit system.        just an idea i've been kicking around in my head recently.

0	most of the people that frequent the sub aren't old enough to vote and still live with their parents. no one who is older and has a family of their own cares that much about who their parents and other family members are voting for.       the other thing i've noticed while lurking comments there is the sheer number of non-us citizens chime in all the time. here in the u.s. we don't say 'uni', we say 'college'. we don't go on 'holiday', we go on 'vacation'. we don't say 'mate', we don't 'take the piss', and most of us don't say 'cheers'. we don't use an 's' for a 'z' as in civilization, or authorize, and we don't use a 'u' in words like 'color'. the comments there are filled with that shit.

1	all that you just mentioned birthed the alt reich movement. what the fuck is a breitbart anyways? i'd never heard of it before the alt reich, maybe it was around, but certainly not in the same way. sufficient that most people hadn't heard of it.      the cause and effect between the russians and the alt reich is really well documented, is that what you want help on?      these lonely white nerd dudes were always sexist, but it took a subversive directed force to motivate organise and radicalise them into the anti-woman activism we saw in gamer hate. those groups went on to form the basis of the alt reich, nay the very definitive core of it.      none of this has any leaps or unusual or out there ideas. these are all mainstays of the current and recent years media cycle.

0	> if someone wants to take the risk and go helmetless, knowing what they are getting themselves into, they should have the right to make that choice - even if i don't personally agree with the merits of it.      a factor that people like this forget is that wrecklessly endangering yourself doesn't just increase the risk of injury and death, it wastes medical resources as well.      emts are often overworked and rushing to get from one emergency to another. by not wearing a seatbelt or helmet, a minor accident potentially goes from something you walk away from to something where emts have to lose time trying to stabilise and/or resuscitate you. this being time in which they might not be able to attend to people who got hurt for non-moronic reasons, read: not because they were too stubborn to take basic safety precautions.

0	i believe this is a valid option.  either way something get's inflated - the asset market or the physical market that we drop money from helicopters on.  the idea that all new debt created by central banks has landed in asset markets is also a bit oversimplified.  the fed ultimately supports the us govt's overspending.  there have been helicopters dropping cash onto universities (govt backed student loans) and healthcare (medicare, medicaid, obama care, expansion of benefits to illegal immigrants, etc......).  bottom line is that we also saw prices for both healthcare and college tuition skyrocket over the last 10+ years due to mmt in action without any corresponding increase in supply.  with unlimited $$'s being thrown at colleges and healthcare - prices have only moved in one direction.

0	i've had numerous posts removed from r/politics now, usually ones simply espousing left wing (by which i mean actually-left-wing, not "vote blue no matter who" liberalism) and/or anti imperialist viewpoints. most in that sub have been reinstated, but the mods refuse to tell me why my comments were deleted. allegedly it was "false positives" picked up by their bot, and telling me why my comments got picked up will "let bad actors defeat the bot."      this isn't just limited to r/politics, though. i've had dozens of comments removed now from various subreddits. the most recent was a response to the question "what's wrong with being a landlord," which broke no rules and yet was shadow deleted a few hours later (implying to me that it was a manual deletion, not a bot).       i think this is all so fucked up. if you disagree with me, downvote me, argue with me, don't arbitrarily remove my responses.      if my comment breaks rules, delete it and inform me of the rule violation, don't just insidiously delete it for everyone *but* me without me even being aware of the fact or the reason why.       i'm getting increasingly angry over all of this. there's literally no recourse except to pm the mods and hope for an answer, but if they don't want to reinstate your comment then fuck you. it's absurd.       just wanted to let everyone know that this is sop on reddit right now, so if you've ever chimed in on a discussion only to have 0 upvotes, downvotes, or comments- check to see if you've been shadow censored.
0	so, deku then?
0	sorry dude, if they didn't link to the post/comment that got you suspended, then you'll never know for sure because it sounds to me like they did an ip check on your ass.       you got to be careful with alot of subs. you never know which one has an admin alt account that is a mod.

1	no, it is factually true. if you don't have dysphoria, that means you're comfortable with your genitals, meaning you aren't trans.      > in reference to genders? unknown. as gender is a psychological way of thinking there is theoretically countless genders.      gender is "how comfortable you are with your genitals". if you have a penis and are ok with it, you're a man, if not, you're a transwoman, and the same for vaginas.      don't confuse "gender roles" with "gender". being a man doesn't preclude you from wearing dresses and being a woman doesn't preclude you from working as a trucker.      > in reference to biological sex? a confirmed minimum of 4. as sex is a physical characteristic, at the moment we can confirm 4 different sex characteristics (penis, vagina, both p & v or neither) but this could change in the future.      there's no biological basis for this. anomalies are exactly that, anomalies, they do not form part of the characteristics of the species, and humans are a sexual species, meaning two sexes.      > with all of this gender/sex/sexuality discussions we need to remember that it's a change field of research and if my years of sexology education and research has told me anything, it's that everything we know is changing and we're finding out more and more about human sexuality every single day.      humans aren't special, we're exactly like almost every other mammal as far as sex comes.
